										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On average, <a href="https://au.marketo.com/lead-nurturing/">50% of the leads in any system are not yet ready to buy</a>. As B2B Marketers, we are responsible for nurturing these leads through the customer journey, to ultimately drive conversion.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="Nurturing%20can%20also%20be%20used%20throughout%20the%20entire%20customer%20lifecycle.%20For%20example,%20engagement%20campaigns%20can%20be%20created%20to%20onboard%20new%20customers,%20revive%20dormant%20leads,%20and%20run%20renewal%20campaigns%20to%20current%20accounts.">&#8220;49% of high performing marketing teams use lead nurturing, as compared to only 19% of moderate performers and 10% of underperformers.&#8221;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="/lead-generation-4/">Lead nurturing campaigns</a> are key to building client relationships during the long, complex B2B sales cycle. This type of campaign gives B2B marketers the ability to move leads through the buyer journey from their first interaction with the business through to the final purchasing decision. Lead nurturing can also continue to be used throughout the entire customer lifecycle after purchase to create customer loyalty, advocacy and even generate referrals. It is the most effective way to ensure you are making the most of your marketing lists and are not losing valuable leads, sales opportunities or customers due to a lack of communication.</p>
<p>As sales funnels are getting longer and buyers are becoming more independent, effective lead nurturing is becoming more and more important. However, more digital marketers are becoming aware of the strategy, so if your brand isn’t currently nurturing prospects, your competitors probably are. If you’re not currently using lead nurturing in your <a href="/">b2b marketing</a> campaigns, it&#8217;s time to consider it.</p>
<h2>What Exactly is Lead Nurturing?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.marketo.com/">Marketo</a>, a leading provider of automated marketing services, 50% of leads are not yet ready to buy. In addition, a study by <a href="https://www.marketingsherpa.com/">MarketingSherpa</a> found that around 80% of new leads don’t convert to sales. Lead nurturing is the most effective way to combat these statistics.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, lead nurturing is the process of developing relationships with prospects at every stage of the sales funnel to move them through the sales journey. It focuses marketing efforts on listening to the needs of prospects, and providing them with the information and answers that they need at different stages of their buyer journey. As relevance and efficiency are improved with lead nurturing, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/30901/30-thought-provoking-lead-nurturing-stats-you-can-t-ignore.aspx">companies that excel at lead nurturing generate 50% more sales-ready leads at a 33% lower cost</a>.</p>
<h2>How Lead Scoring Impacts Lead Nurturing</h2>
<p>Lead scoring is a vital element of any lead nurturing campaign. In fact, there’s not much point in running a lead nurturing campaign without it.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.lenskold.com/content/LeadGenStudy_2013.html">68% of successful marketers cite lead scoring based on content and engagement as the most effective tactic for improving revenue contribution from lead nurturing.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The importance of lead scoring should not be underestimated. Without it, you don’t know which prospects are most engaged and it’s more difficult to identify where they are in their buyer journey. However, despite the overwhelming reasons to implement lead scoring, currently, <a href="https://content.marketingsherpa.com/data/public/reports/benchmark-reports/BMR-B2B_Marketing.pdf">only 21% of B2B marketers are using it</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with lead scoring, it is a process that is used to rank prospects based on the perceived value of the lead to the company. Most marketing automation platforms offer a lead scoring functionality that can be implemented by assigning numeric values to certain actions such as clicks, events, or even social media interactions. The score is then used by digital marketers to determine which leads are sales qualified and should be followed up by the sales team, and which leads need more nurturing to move them further through the sales funnel to purchase.</p>
<p>In order to effectively develop a lead nurturing strategy, digital marketers have to implement a strategic <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/lead-scoring-instructions">lead scoring</a> system. To do this effectively, it is vital to get input from both the marketing and sales teams. Consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the lead scoring threshold where a lead becomes sales qualified?</li>
<li>What actions are most valuable to your company and as such, hold a higher weight for lead scoring?</li>
<li>Should certain actions result in negative scoring?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the scoring system is in place, you can start to develop your lead nurturing tactics.</p>
<h2>The Most Effective Lead Nurturing Tactics<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7586" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lead-Nurturing.png" alt="Lead Nurturing" width="850" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lead-Nurturing.png 850w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lead-Nurturing-450x106.png 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lead-Nurturing-768x181.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>The key to effective lead nurturing is to identify which targets are interested in your offering and when to connect with them. It’s about a marketing conversation: communicating with your customers and prospects regularly with content from your company so you leave an imprint on their mind until they need you. The following are some of the best ways to do this.</p>
<h3> 1. Create Targeted Content</h3>
<p>Leads nurtured with targeted content produce an <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/what-is-lead-nurturing">increase in sales opportunities of more than 20%</a>. By strategically targeting your leads with content that is relevant to them, you can accelerate their buyer journey.</p>
<p>However, many B2B marketers struggle with this. A <a href="http://www.forrester.com/The+Forrester+Wave+LeadToRevenue+Management+Platform+Vendors+Q1+2014/fulltext/-/E-RES95221">Forrester Research</a> report stated that 33% of B2B marketers said “targeted delivery of content” was their biggest challenge to lead nurturing. In order to effectively get the right content to the right people at the right time, you need to first understand your target audience. Once you have identified this audience, you need to create a range of content that engages the audience based on their interests, goals, objectives, and motivations. The content should also line up with their specific point in the buyer journey.</p>
<h3> 2. Follow Up On-Time <strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>If you follow up with a lead within five minutes of them entering the sales process, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/average-lead-response-time-sales-data">they are 21 times more likely to become a qualified lead than if you contact them after 30 minutes</a>. The benefits of acting quickly are obvious. However, this does take a bit of manual effort and a human touch.</p>
<p>While automated lead nurturing can help you reach large groups of prospects quickly and efficiently, a follow-up phone call or personal email is the most effective way to convert leads into sales qualified leads. In addition, a timely, well-researched call to a warm lead is much more effective than spending your time on outbound telemarketing. In order to really make the most of the sales opportunity, make sure you know exactly what the prospects is interested in and how they have interacted with your business online. Before you call them it can also be helpful to do a quick Google search of their company so that you know exactly what they do before calling them.</p>
<h3>3. Don’t Restrict Lead Nurturing to Email</h3>
<p>59% of B2B marketers say email is their <a href="http://content.myemma.com/blog/9-sizzling-marketing-stats-from-this-summer">most effective channel</a> in terms of revenue generation. While the channel is undeniably effective for B2B marketers, it’s important to ensure that your campaign incorporates more than just email. Many lead nurturing strategies consist of setting up an email drip campaign that regularly sends emails to prospects. However, with so many digital options now available and programs that can help streamline campaigns across them all, there’s no excuse to stick solely to email. In fact, your campaign will be more effective with the addition of more channels.</p>
<p>The most effective lead nurturing tactics span channels, with a combination of marketing automation, email marketing, social media, remarketing and sales outreach. This will obviously require a bit more effort in terms of set up and ongoing maintenance of the campaign. Your sales and marketing teams will also have to have to work together to execute it effectively. However, when done right, your business’ bottom line will reap the rewards of multi-channel lead nurturing.</p>
<h3>4. Use Multiple Touchpoints</h3>
<p>Prospects have to receive, on average, <a href="https://www.entergagevideos.com/12-touches-close-deal/">twelve marketing touches from the time they are introduced to the top of funnel until they convert</a>. As such, any <a href="/4-lead-nurturing-stages-crucial-to-your-marketing-success/">lead nurturing campaign</a> should really have 12 or more touchpoints. Ideally, you should be communicating with your prospects through a range of different types of content such as email, social media posts, blog articles, whitepapers, interactive surveys and even direct mail, to nurture your prospects into customers. The content that you send should be aligned to their point in the buyer journey, addressing common questions and concerns at that specific stage.</p>
<h3>5. Align Sales &amp; Marketing</h3>
<p>When sales and marketing teams share the responsibility of lead nurturing, businesses see a significant increase in conversion rates. The most important thing to make sure sales and marketing are on the same page with, is the identification of a ‘sales qualified lead’. Sales and marketing should agree on the point where a prospect should transition from being ‘marketing qualified’ to being ‘sales qualified’. This comes down to lead scoring. Both parties should work together to agree how valuable certain actions are in the lead nurturing process, for example opening an email or interacting with a social post, and assign a score to each. By ensuring both teams work together in this way, you can create more defined roles and shared expectations for the campaign.</p>
<h3>6. Personalisation</h3>
<p>Personalisation is key to an effective lead nurturing program. It’s also not too difficult to implement, particularly in the email component of the campaign. <a href="http://www.experian.com/marketing-services/email-market-study-2013.html">Personalised emails can generate up to six times higher revenue per email than non-personalised emails</a>. Emails can be personalised in a number of ways, for example, you can set up triggers to send emails when a visitor clicks a link in your email, visits a certain page on your site, or downloads a piece of gated content. It can also be useful to send a personalised email when a prospect is highly engaged with your brand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/b2b-marketing-consultants/">B2B Marketing</a> is characterised by long sales cycles and more considered purchases. You typically won’t sell a software solution to a multinational corporation the first time they hear of your business.</p>
<p>As such, the process of B2B marketing is about nurturing relationships and slowly moving the leads that you get through the <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/296526">sales funnel</a> until they eventually convert. This is most effective when your business’ communications with prospects are tailored to their industry, position or interests.</p>
<p>But how do you find out all of that information to even get them in the funnel in the first place?</p>
<p>Create an effective Lead Magnet.</p>
<h2>What is a Lead Magnet?</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Even if you haven’t heard the term ‘Lead Magnet’, you’ve probably come across them in one way or another.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>A Lead Magnet is something of value that you can offer a prospect in exchange for them providing you with their details and information. The most common type of Lead Magnet that you’ve likely seen online is a free guide or report that’s delivered in PDF format. However, you can only access this PDF once you’ve entered your email address.</p>
<p>The goal of the Lead Magnet is to maximise the number of relevant leads you are getting for your business, or a specific campaign that you are running.</p>
<h2>Why Your Business Need a Lead Magnet</h2>
<p>Lead Magnets make your job as a marketer easier and more effective.</p>
<p>Getting contact information and details from a relevant prospect is very valuable to a B2B marketer. By showing an interest in your content, the products or services you sell are likely to be relevant to them, so they are already a qualified lead. Obtaining more information about the prospect allows you to follow up with them with more relevant content that is specifically designed to move them further through the buying journey.</p>
<p>An effective Lead Magnet will grab the attention of your target audience and deliver something that adds real value to them. By attracting leads with an offer like this, you are immediately capturing their interest in your business and creating a positive relationship with your brand right from the start.</p>
<h2>Different Types of Lead Magnets to Consider</h2>
<p>Lead Magnets come in all different shapes and sizes. The most effective for your business will depend on your target customer and the products or services that you provide.</p>
<p>Your Lead Magnet should be targeted to address the specific prospects you want to attract. If it isn’t highly relevant to your target audience, they won’t part with their details for it. So, even if your business targets several buyer personas, each Lead Magnet should be tailored to a single one of them. The following are some excellent ideas for Lead Magnets to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offer a ‘Content Upgrade’: </strong>This is a great way to generate more leads from your blog. If you have a well performing blog such as <a href="/5-ways-to-optimize-your-b2b-google-ads-campaign/">6 Ways to Optimise your Google Ads Campaign</a>, you can create a ‘content upgrade’ where you offer the readers access to an additional 5 tips by providing their email address.</li>
<li><strong>Offer a Free-Trial or Product Sample: </strong>If your business offers a service that you can deliver electronically such as a website audit or campaign proposal, you can capture leads by offering them a free sample. Another common technique, particularly for SaaS companies, is to offer a free product demo for a defined period of time.</li>
<li><strong>Offer Your Expert Advice: </strong>If you provide a service, or are perceived as an expert in your field, you could create a Lead Magnet that offers prospects a free review. Insurance brokers commonly use this type of lead magnet by offering to audit a potential client’s existing policy.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Quiz or Survey: </strong>This is a fun and creative way to generate social engagement with your brand. In addition, once a user has taken the time to answer the questions, they’re more likely to give you their email address in order to receive their results.</li>
<li><strong>Consider an Exit Intent Pop Up: </strong>An exit intent pop-up identifies when a visitor is going to leave your site and then shows a pop-up that then asks them to sign up to a newsletter or download an interesting piece of content. While this may seem frustrating for users, there’s no denying that it often works. A <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/recommends/unbounce-case-study/">case study shared on Unbounce</a> showed a 14.47% conversion rate from an exit intent pop-up, which is extremely high for website signup forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re still not sure what exactly to offer your customers, simply choose a Lead Magnet that you are confident in creating. Remember it should be written completely with the audience in mind and offer them something of value.</p>
<p>One last thing … Once you have your Lead Magnet and are gathering all this useful information on your target customers, make sure you put it to good use with an effective <a href="/lead-generation/lead-nurturing/">Lead Nurturing</a> campaign.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Considering <a href="http://www.piworld.com/post/67-of-the-buyers-journey-is-now-done-digitally-3-ways-to-deal-with-this/">67% of the buyer’s journey is now done digitally</a>, your brand won’t survive long nowadays without a website.</p>
<p>Smart companies invest time and resources designing the front end of their website to ensure it creates creditability and trust in the brand and generates leads for the business. Even smarter companies also invest time and resources looking at analytics from the back end of their website. By spending time examining specific website metrics and applying knowledge to improve the overall user experience, you can significantly increase your website’s ability to generate leads and move prospects through the buyer journey.</p>
<p>The following metrics can all be found on <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and are an excellent starting point to look at optimising your website.</p>
<h2>Bounce Rate</h2>
<p>The bounce rate is one of the most important metrics to look at on any website. This is when a visitor comes to the site and leaves immediately without visiting any other pages or interacting with the page. Having a high bounce rate basically means that users are not spending a lot of time on the site, which can be indicative of a number of things. The first consideration is that traffic sources may be sending irrelevant visitors to the website. If this isn’t the case and you think you are getting targeted visitors, your landing pages may need to be optimised for better user experience. This can be for a number of reasons, such as poor design, slow load times, or a confusing page structure.</p>
<p>It’s important to be aware that blogs will often have a high bounce rate as visitors tend to only stay on the website in order to read one single post and then they will move on. As such, it can be useful to exclude blog pages when looking at the bounce rate of the site as a whole.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bounce-Rate.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4573 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bounce-Rate.png" alt="Bounce Rate" width="2832" height="1176" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bounce-Rate.png 2832w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bounce-Rate-300x125.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bounce-Rate-768x319.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bounce-Rate-1024x425.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2832px) 100vw, 2832px" /></a></p>
<h2>Traffic Sources</h2>
<p>Most websites get their traffic from a number of different sources, such as AdWords, Social Media and Search Engines as well as visitors that come from other websites or direct to the site. By looking at how traffic from each of these sources behaves when they are on the website, you can identify which are the most effective channels in driving visitors to your website that convert to leads. Armed with this information, you can then dedicate marketing budget and resources accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Channels.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4572 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Channels.png" alt="Traffic Sources" width="2836" height="1232" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Channels.png 2836w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Channels-300x130.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Channels-768x334.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Channels-1024x445.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2836px) 100vw, 2836px" /></a></p>
<h2>Average Session Duration</h2>
<p>The Average Session Duration is the amount of time that a user spends on your website. Generally speaking, the longer the user spends on the site the better, as this indicates that the content on the website is engaging and relevant to them. That being said, if the number of Pageviews is low and the Session Duration is high, this can suggest that the visitor is struggling to navigate the site. In this instance, you can look at making the pages more user friendly with clear calls to action so that the user can find what they are looking for quicker.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Avg-Session.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4571 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Avg-Session.png" alt="Average Session Duration" width="2836" height="1232" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Avg-Session.png 2836w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Avg-Session-300x130.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Avg-Session-768x334.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Avg-Session-1024x445.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2836px) 100vw, 2836px" /></a></p>
<h2>New Vs Returning Visitors</h2>
<p>New visitors will interact differently with your website than returning visitors. As they are interacting with your website for the first time, they don’t have any idea how to best navigate the site, so gaining insight from their user experience can be extremely valuable. If conversion rate for new visitors is low, it’s likely that the website is not user friendly and is not driving visitors to perform the desired call to action. In addition, if the bounce rate is high for new visitors, this will indicate that it is not easy for them to find what they are looking for. You can use these learnings to optimise the website so that it performs better for new users going forward.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/New-_-Returning.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4575 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/New-_-Returning.png" alt="New vs Returning " width="2836" height="918" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/New-_-Returning.png 2836w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/New-_-Returning-300x97.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/New-_-Returning-768x249.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/New-_-Returning-1024x331.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2836px) 100vw, 2836px" /></a></p>
<h2>Exit Pages</h2>
<p>Working out which pages users are leaving the site on can help you maximise conversions on your website. The exit pages report can help you identify why they are leaving and make changes accordingly. Is the design of the page wrong, is the content of the page irrelevant, or is it just too confusing to navigate?</p>
<p>Another consideration is to look at the steps to conversion. The steps to complete the desired call to action should be a maximum of three pages from the landing page. A more complicated process is likely to confuse the website visitor, and they are unlikely to put the required effort in to continue through to purchase. By identifying which point in the process they are dropping off, you can then try to remove obstacles to purchase and move visitors through the buyer journey.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Exit-Pages.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4574 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Exit-Pages.png" alt="Exit Pages" width="2832" height="1244" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Exit-Pages.png 2832w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Exit-Pages-300x132.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Exit-Pages-768x337.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Exit-Pages-1024x450.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2832px) 100vw, 2832px" /></a></p>
<h2>Cost Per Conversion</h2>
<p>Without measuring conversions, it’s almost impossible to track success. As a B2B company, your conversion won’t necessarily mean a purchase, but any action the visitor performs that is deemed valuable to the business, such as downloading a resource, signing up to an email list or making an enquiry. These can all be set up as goals in Google Analytics, with different values assigned to each, depending how valuable you think that action is to your business.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Conversions.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4570 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Conversions.png" alt="Cost Per Conversion" width="2832" height="1252" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Conversions.png 2832w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Conversions-300x133.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Conversions-768x340.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Conversions-1024x453.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2832px) 100vw, 2832px" /></a></p>
<p>These statistics are just a starting point. Google Analytics has a wealth of features and metrics that can all be used to evaluate and enhance the buyer journey. At the Lead Agency, we have a detailed look at the analytics of any website before we start a campaign. We then apply that information to optimise our clients’ websites into an effective lead generation tool.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The process of stimulating and capturing interest in a product or service, <a href="/lead-generation/">Lead Generation</a> is vital for attracting new customers to your business.</p>
<p>Traditionally, leads would come from sources such as personal referrals, telemarketing, direct marketing, advertisements and events. While these lead generation strategies are still relevant, the world has become more digitalised, and so too must our lead generation tactics.</p>
<p>A 2015 study conducted by eMarketer found email marketing to be the most-used channel for generating leads, followed by content marketing and search engine optimisation; proving that online lead generation has taken over. The following are several tactics used by today’s digital marketers that can be used by SMEs across sectors to increase their leads.</p>
<h3><strong>Optimise Your Website for Lead Generation</strong></h3>
<p>A website that is optimised for lead generation will have a succinct value proposition identifying the key problems or needs of the customer that your products or services can solve. This should be obvious to visitors within the first few seconds on the website while you have their maximum attention.</p>
<p>In order to generate leads from your website, it’s important to drive action. Clear calls-to-action such as relevant offers, an opportunity to sign up to a business newsletter, or a useful article or eBook should be put in place in order to capture not only the user’s interest but also their details for your business.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4671" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/seo.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="380" /></p>
<h3><strong>Search Engine Optimisation </strong></h3>
<p>Search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! conduct over 100 billion global searches each month [Search Engine Journal, 2013], so appearing at the top of the results page can provide a huge lead generation opportunity. If you can optimise your website for search engines, you will end up on your prospects’ shortlist when they search for answers or solutions to their problems.</p>
<p>There are many techniques you can apply to your website to increase its chances of appearing in search results. Refer to our previous blog, ‘What is SEO?’ for more in-depth information on the topic.</p>
<h3><strong>Online Networking</strong></h3>
<p>Online networking is about getting your services and products noticed through making the right connections and providing an easy way for prospects to connect with your company.</p>
<p>Social media is the number one activity that people do online [Business Insider, 2013], providing an excellent opportunity for businesses to network with prospects. By considering your business and what it sells, and evaluating the channels most relevant to your audience, you can leverage the power of social media marketing to increase your audience and customer base.</p>
<p>Other online networking techniques include attending, webinars relevant to your industry, hosting significant online events, and sharing and responding to relevant content from other businesses that you are (or want to be) affiliated with.</p>
<h3><strong>Create Sharable Content</strong></h3>
<p>While content may not necessarily generate many direct leads for your business, it’s still one of the most effective drivers of leads to a website. The more content you create, the better for affects your <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-seo/">SEO</a> and increases your chances of being found online. The statistics speak for themselves, with 67% of B2B companies that blog generating more leads than companies that don’t [WebDAM, 2014].</p>
<p>Get creative with your <a href="/b2b-marketing-services/b2b-content-marketing/">content marketing</a> and publish a range of pieces from blogs, to eBooks, White Papers and video content. The more in-depth pieces of work are ideal for establishing thought leadership, while videos and blogs are inherently sharable amongst the masses, and perfect to expand the reach of your company; generating new leads for your business by getting you noticed by new potential customers.</p>
<h3><strong>Pay Per Click (PPC) Advertising</strong></h3>
<p>PPC advertising is a type of online lead generation, where advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. As these adverts can be quickly created and run instantly, PPC can provide much quicker results than using search engine optimisation to earn visits organically.</p>
<p>There are many forms of PPC advertising that can be used for lead generation. Search engine advertising is one of the most popular as it gives businesses the opportunity to be noticed by prospects when they are searching for similar products or services, effectively generating new leads for the company.</p>
<p>In order to survive today’s volatile business environment, businesses need to be able to continuously generate more leads, and better quality leads. By following the above steps, you will be able to use your website and online presence to its full lead generating potential.</p>
<p>Any other questions in regard to <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/">B2B Digital Marketing</a>, don&#8217;t hesitate and call the Lead Agency experts in <a href="/b2b-marketing-services/">business to business marketing</a> today!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You see a gorgeous girl (or guy) at a party. You go up to them and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a fantastic catch, you should go on a date with me.&#8221;</p>
<h4>That&#8217;s Direct Marketing.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re at a party with a bunch of friends and see a beautiful guy/girl. One of your friends goes up to her and pointing at you says, &#8220;He&#8217;s a fantastic person, kind and interesting. You two should go on a date.&#8221;</p>
<h4>That&#8217;s Advertising.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see someone you’re interested in dating at a party. You go up to them and get their telephone number. The next day you call and say, &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m a real catch, we should date.&#8221;</p>
<h4>That&#8217;s Telemarketing.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re at a party and see a gorgeous girl/guy. You run to the bathroom and make sure your hair is neat and your clothes are smart. You go up to them and pour them a drink and offer them a cocktail snack. You praise them for their clothes and style, take interest in what they like to talk about. At the end of the evening you offer them a ride home, and then say, &#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m quite the catch, let’s go on a date.&#8221;</p>
<h4>That&#8217;s Public Relations.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re at a party and see someone worth dating. They walk up to you and say, I hear you&#8217;re quite the catch, let’s go on a date.&#8221;</p>
<h4>That&#8217;s Brand Recognition.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re on your way to a party when you realise that there are thousands of potential partners in all the houses you&#8217;re passing. So you climb onto the roof of one situated in the middle and shout at the top of your voice, &#8220;I&#8217;m a real catch and fantastic in bed!&#8221;</p>
<h4>That&#8217;s Mass Marketing.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re at the same party and one of the people you’re interested in falls for your technique. They say they’re interested in you and agree to go on a date. On that first date you ask them to marry you.</p>
<h2><strong>That’s why you need Lead Nurturing in <a href="/b2b-marketing-services/">business marketing</a>.</strong></h2>
<p>Most people don’t ask someone to marry them on the first date. We all know that making a decision like that isn’t taken lightly. So why should your dealings with customers be any different? In business marketing, you don’t expect to close a customer the first time you meet them at a networking event. So why do you think someone will stumble across your website and buy what you’re selling?</p>
<p>People operate on their own schedule. They’re not ready to buy when you want them to buy. According to the <a href="http://www.aberdeen.com/research/8740/ra-event-lead-marketing/content.aspx">Aberdeen Group</a>, it takes 10 marketing-driven “touches” on average to progress a lead from the top of the funnel to a customer.</p>
<p>As someone focusing on business marketing, how do you create those touch points in a scalable and affordable way? The answer is lead nurturing.</p>
<h3>What is Lead Nurturing?</h3>
<p>Lead nurturing is the process of building relationships with potential clients (people who are likely to have a need for your product, service or solution) and moving them down your sales funnel from:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2986" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/B2B-SALES-FUNNEL.png" alt="B2B SALES FUNNEL" width="620" height="643" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/B2B-SALES-FUNNEL.png 620w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/B2B-SALES-FUNNEL-289x300.png 289w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>until they are ready to buy.</p>
<p>Effective lead nurturing focuses regular communication on listening to the needs of prospects, the drivers and objections and providing the information and they need to move through to the next stage of your sales funnel. Through regular email marketing, whitepapers, blog posts, through to additional sales calls, a lead nurturing program provides multiple opportunities for a business to communicate with its customers and prospects.</p>
<p>Lead nurturing allows you to capture the attention of someone who’s interested in what you do, regardless of their timing to buy, so that you earn their business when they are ready to buy.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Lead Nurturing</h2>
<p>With an effective lead nurturing program for your business marketing, more of your prospects are converted into sales. At the same time, your marketing Return On Investment is also better as you don’t lose as many prospects.</p>
<p>Companies that excel at lead nurturing generate 50% more sales ready leads at a 33% lower cost (Marketo).</p>
<p>There are three key benefits of lead nurturing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Generate more sales leads with no more investment</strong> — You have already allocated your marketing budget to build a sales funnel of new prospects. Lead nurturing makes it easier to continue to reach out to those prospects without spending any more marketing dollars. A DemandGen Report found nurtured leads yield a 20% increase in sales opportunities versus non-nurtured leads on average.</li>
<li><strong>Be seen as a trusted advisor with your prospects</strong> — Lead nurturing builds relationships through credibility and trust by providing relevant and useful information. B2B purchase decisions are often complicated, whether it is about switching from one supplier to another or trying a new service. If buyers believe that you understand their problems and you provide information and answers to the questions they have, you will be seen favourably and have a greater chance of being selected.</li>
<li><strong>Smarketing: enhancing your sales/marketing alignment</strong> — Lead nurturing reduces the number of leads from marketing activities that are ignored by sales by as much as 80%. Only 25% of leads developed by marketing are legitimate and should advance to sales. (Source: Gleanster). But with a lead nurturing program in place, leads become better qualified and interested so that your sales team can work with them to close.</li>

<p style="text-align: center;">[<a href="https://placester.com/real-estate-marketing-academy/infographic-hot-or-not-the-best-methods-for-finding-new-b2b-customers-in-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Placester</a>, 2014]
<p>B2B <a href="/lead-generation/">Lead Generation</a> is a topic shrouded with uncertainty and doubt. With various studies and experts preaching countless different “essentials” for B2B marketers to focus on, it can be extremely daunting and confusing as a small business to even know where to start.</p>
<p>And so perplexed small business marketers turn to Google to try and answer the ever-present question: “How can I succeed in B2B Lead Generation?” The outcome of such a search will provide puzzled marketers with advice from some of the leading B2B companies. The tactics that these companies preach most often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search Marketing</li>
<li>Social Marketing</li>
<li><a href="/b2b-marketing-services/b2b-content-marketing/">Content Marketing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these tactics encompass an Inbound Marketing approach to B2B Lead Generation, utilising digital media channels. That’s to say that it is up to the customer to find you. This is not entirely surprising given the digital-first age we are currently living in, however, when we are viewing B2B Lead Generation through the eyes of a small business it is not always feasible to expect prospects to be able to find you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we look closer at the various favoured categories of B2B Lead Generation tactics we find that Outbound Marketing actually proves to be the most effective strategy as a whole. That’s to say that the company initiates the conversation and sends their message out to their audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B2BLGmethods.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2897" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B2BLGmethods-256x300.png" alt="B2B Lead Generation Methods" width="360" height="422" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B2BLGmethods-256x300.png 256w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B2BLGmethods.png 375w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B2BLGcategories.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2898" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B2BLGcategories-300x259.png" alt="B2B Lead Generation Categories" width="440" height="379" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B2BLGcategories-300x259.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/B2BLGcategories.png 435w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></a>[<a href="https://placester.com/real-estate-marketing-academy/infographic-hot-or-not-the-best-methods-for-finding-new-b2b-customers-in-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Placester</a>, 2014]
<p>Outbound Marketing tends to have a bad name as being an outdated approach to Lead Generation, and while it does have its drawbacks, these limitations tend to effect larger companies much more so than small to medium enterprises (SMEs). The “issues” large companies have with Outbound Marketing are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outbound Marketing campaigns are difficult to track, especially when compared to tacking the digital alternatives.</li>
<li>Outbound techniques aren’t as commonly used anymore so no one wants to accept them (Do not call lists, spam filters, etc).</li>
<li>It’s higher cost than inbound, with the chances of a low yield result.</li>
</ul>
<p>These arguments and connotations exist as a result of the beliefs of big brands, because they would need to implement Outbound Tactics on a scale far greater than is utilised for small businesses in a simple B2B Lead Generation campaign.</p>
<p>Outbound Tactics for small businesses tend to be hugely successful for companies aiming to make a splash, with a smaller number of prospects, in order to secure a handful of quality leads. Outbound Marketing could be the perfect approach for your small business! It’s not about how many prospects you have; it is about the value of those prospects and the worth they have for the company.</p>
<p>Search Engine Optimisation, Social Media Marketing and Content Marketing are all incredibly powerful tools, which should not be neglected, but as a starting point they are useless for the purposes of B2B Lead Generation for your small business. So what should you do now? What’s a simple and effective Outbound Marketing tactic for your B2B Lead Generation campaign?</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Direct Mail Marketing:</strong><strong> </strong></h2>
<p>Gone are the days when we are excited to receive every email.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mail-vs-email.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2883 alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mail-vs-email-265x300.jpg" alt="Email vs Mail" width="250" height="283" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mail-vs-email-265x300.jpg 265w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mail-vs-email.jpg 517w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">[activerain, 2011]
<p>One way to stand out to your prospects and spark their interest for you over your competitors is to put the effort into a piece of physical mail. Don’t fall into the trap of becoming just another email that a CEO must reluctantly paw through each morning, create a physical presence.</p>
<p>Direct Mail is tricky, but when done right it can be extremely effective. All you need to do is get creative. Don&#8217;t think that you can simply print another, run-of-the mill template letter, place it in your every-day envelope and gain a quality lead. Put something exciting, enticing and different on your prospect’s desk to get your content read and their <a href="/lead-generation/attract-customers-with-lead-generation-campaigns/">interest sparked</a>.</p>
<p>When you are sending Direct Mail to prospects you need to be creative in order to be seen. Often the person you are trying to reach has a gatekeeper; to get to the boss you’ll have to first get past their secretary. You can’t put another letter, which looks like all the others, onto a receptionist’s desk, and expect them to present it to a CEO as a priority.</p>
<p>Try these simple, but effective Direct Mail Marketing tactics next time to get your mail opened by your prospect and maximise your B2B Lead Generation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Send more than a letter:</strong></h3>
<p>Parcels and packages are much more likely to be passed on from a receptionist to their boss than a standard sized envelope, as they appear far more significant and may hold something of value to the recipient.</p>
<p>A receptionist will tend to file away enquiry letters for future review but packages present as more important to pass along so that the boss can have immediate access to its contents. More than words, there is a physical good being delivered.</p>
<p>Think long and hard about what you want to put into this package. It could be a free sample of your product or a book that details your service offering, however, we have found that some of the most effective parcels are far more obscure… A CEO may not recall your sample product in a few weeks time, but if you are a business which offers, for example, travel assistance and you send through a miniature globe or toy airplane for example. That CEO will be a little perplexed, yes, but they won’t soon forget you. You can then follow up with a call and have the easy introduction of “Hi, I’m the one who sent you an airplane last week”.</p>
<p>This tactic can effectively break the ice and create a memorable experience that captures prospects <a href="/lead-generation/engage-your-targets/">attention</a> and maximises your chances of being heard over your competitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Hand-write!</strong></h3>
<p>It sounds Stone Age and absurd but it is so rare nowadays to receive a none-typed piece of physical mail that when one does arrive it tends to stand out from the pack. Creating a point of difference between yours and your competitors’ mail is essential. Hand-written notes (including the address on the envelope itself) have a powerful presence and exhibit a certain level of added effort on the mailers part because the audience can recognise that it takes more effort to customise print media than digital. This could be the deciding factor between prospects choosing your service over your competitors.</p>
<p>This tactic is along the same lines as the above package strategy but can be done so in a less, some may say “obnoxious” way.</p>
<p>Another way to utilise hand-written notes to get through the gatekeeper is to fool them in to thinking that you know their boss/supervisor/CEO on a personal level. While a gatekeeper will tend to file prospect letters, they consistently pass on any personal mail to their boss.</p>
<p>Placing post-it notes on letters that personally address the subject appear more sociable and as though there is a pre-existing relationship. Place a note with something along the lines of…</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Postit.png"><img class=" wp-image-2885 alignnone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Postit.png" alt="Personalised Message Post-it Note" width="240" height="240" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Postit.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Postit-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a></p>
<p>…and watch as it is passed from receptionist to superior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a small business it can be hard to be seen and heard over the top of the big brands, so it is in your best interest to utilise outbound tactics in clever, new ways that get you noticed. If you choose to try to go up against large corporations in the inbound, digital realm you have a huge struggle ahead of you.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term “Marketing Automation” has become a buzz-word, with many marketers under the impression that all <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/">digital marketing</a> tools, including those specific to <a href="/lead-generation/">lead generation</a> and overall growth, fall under the category of Marketing Automation. This misconception often leads to unsuccessful automated marketing efforts that do not speak to specific prospect needs and challenges.</p>
<p>It is a common misconception, but let me assure you, that Marketing Automation is not just a fancy name for email marketing! Marketing Automation is any trigger-induced action in a campaign and can take place across all channels – from direct mail and phone campaigns to online and social initiatives.</p>
<p>Marketers must realise that Marketing Automation does not do the lead generation and conversion for you. Genuine prospects must be fed into the marketing funnel in order to see benefits and conversions from automated marketing efforts. Feeding a pre-purchased database of emails the same automated content will only be thought of as spam and isn’t likely to result in genuine leads and customers. Successful automated marketing must draw insights from the myriad of systems available to your company, including Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, lead management systems and web analytics to name a few.</p>
<p>The following <a href="/b2b-marketing-services/b2b-marketing-strategies/">strategies</a> can help you to utilise Marketing Automation properly:</p>
<h2><strong>Drip Marketing</strong></h2>
<p>Drip marketing solves the problem faced by using email newsletters. Whilst email newsletters are a great way to send out your latest announcements, new subscribers only ever see new emails and may never get exposure to your earlier content.</p>
<p>Drip Marketing is a strategy whereby a constant flow of marketing material is sent out to customers over a period of time. The aim being to create sales through long-term, repeat exposure of goods or services that engage, nurture and build loyalty.</p>
<p>These marketing messages often take the form of emails but it is important to note that social media posts, postcards, phone calls, brochures, and printed newsletters are also forms of drip marketing. All of which can, and arguably should, be automated to ensure efficient use of your marketing teams time.</p>
<p>Drip Marketing can be based off a predetermined timeline whereby certain content is fed to the customer at certain times after their initial sign-up, or it can be trigger-induced whereby certain actions will prompt automated marketing materials to be sent i.e. signing up for a service, downloading content or making a purchase could result in certain emails being sent or phone communication being initiated.</p>
<p>Many forms of drip marketing rely on the &#8220;Law of 29&#8221;, which states that most prospects will not buy something until they see an ad for it at least 29 times [Investopedia, 2015]. Ensuring 29 interactions are made with each prospect would be a huge task for any marketing team! Automating the process makes for efficient promotion and higher conversion likelihood.</p>
<h2><strong>Segmentation</strong></h2>
<p>By dividing your contact list for <a href="/lead-generation/lead-nurturing/">lead nurturing</a> based on behaviour, position, industry, company size, geography or any other useful variables you gain the ability to tailor your automated content so that it is more relevant to who you are contacting. One way to determine how you will segment your contacts is to first define a buyer persona, or in other words, who your ideal customer would be. Actionable buyer personas reveal insights about your buyers’ decisions — the specific attitudes, concerns and criteria that drive prospective customers to choose you, your competitor or the status quo. The more personalised your content is to your customer, the higher your chances of interaction and future <a href="/lead-generation/engage-your-targets/">conversion</a>.</p>
<p>Lead scoring is a great way to segment your contacts for your sales team! Scoring is done by determining a ranking for each contact based on certain variables, such as those listed above, the higher the score the better quality the prospective lead and thus the higher chance that nurturing will result in a conversion. Among companies that implemented scoring techniques to better target their marketing, 38% experience higher conversion rates of qualified leads into opportunities, while 31% saw boosts in productivity within their sales department and reduced sales cycles. [SocialGarden, 2015]
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/marketing-automation/">B2B Marketing Automation</a> is just one component in the middle of a successful sales funnel, but if it is done well, it can mark the difference between lapsed or converted leads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Generating more leads is the primary focus for B2B marketers and is also the biggest challenge they face. Without continual optimisation and improvement of your <a href="/lead-generation/">B2B lead generation</a> campaigns, you’ll see your sales pipeline dry up pretty fast. So it’s essential that you stay on top of the latest lead generation trends so you can continue to fuel sales.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May_12.jpg"><br />
</a>Although it is common knowledge in the B2B sphere that lead generation is critical for your business and your clients, it is also listed as a top topic that B2B marketers wanted to learn more about in a survey conducted by Capterra last year. So while marketers know how important lead generation is, it is clear that there is a lot of misunderstanding and uncertainty around the concept and how best to go about it. Lets clear all the confusion up right now:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/chirp/2013/12161/b2b-lead-generation-trends-for-2014-whats-hot-and-whats-not" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2502" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May_12.jpg" alt="May_12" width="650" height="650" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May_12.jpg 650w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May_12-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/05/May_12-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[MarketingProfs, 2013]
<p>49% of B2B marketers cite social media marketing as the most difficult lead generation tactic to execute [eMarketer, 2013]. The above image backs up this statistic; we can see that the worst performing methods for lead generation are made up of the social networking platforms. Pintrest proves to be the worst, method, followed closely by Twitter, Google+ and Facebook, with LinkedIn just climbing above the bottom five.</p>
<p>On average, marketers spend between four and six hours on social media each week [Marketo, 2015]. Are we getting a little carried away here? Time is money and these hours represent a lot of cash going towards social networking especially considering that social networks have been showing a decline in the level of reach companies can achieve organically. “The average organic reach for posts from Facebook pages in March was 2.6 percent of a brand’s audience. … This percentage dropped to 2.3 percent for pages with more than 1 million likes.” [1to1Media, 2015]. So even if you’re posting the most relevant, savvy and interesting information, unless you’re paying for promotion, it’s likely never to reach your audience.</p>
<p>With more than 1.4 billion monthly users on Facebook and 288 million monthly users on Twitter [1to1 Media, 2015], brands that do not establish a social presence fear that they are missing out on the opportunity to increase their brand awareness. However, in the B2B marketing world, social media plays the important role of <strong><a href="/lead-generation/lead-nurturing/">nurturing</a> prospects, not generating them!</strong> These platforms act as a great way of keeping a channel of communication open for already generated leads, and can assist you to nurture these leads until they are ready to engage. The mistake of seeking lead generation rather than utilising these avenues to nurture is one that is all too commonly made by B2B marketers</p>
<p>Time and money would be much better spent on methods that actually yield more, and better quality, leads. No amount of posting will have the same impact on a prospect as the direct impression gained through the top lead generation methods: Inside Sales, Executive Events, Telemarketing, Tradeshows &amp; Conferences and Email &amp; eNewsletters.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you should wave your white flags in defeat and shutdown all social media efforts immediately. There can be some lead generation benefits associated with social efforts. 44% of B2B marketers have generated leads via LinkedIn, 39% have generated leads through Facebook and 30% through Twitter [ReachForce, 2014]. However, there is no number to indicate the quality of these leads, the class of which will not compare to leads generated through the top performing methods. Your time on social media would be much better spent nurturing the leads you have already generated via other means than by trying to attract new prospects</p>
<p>With the influence and rapid development of the digital world, the marketing landscape is ever evolving. Marketers, it seems, will always be one step behind the latest software. Moments after installing the newest program it seems to be already out of date. So don’t go crazy spending 6 hours of every weeks staring longingly at your Facebook page, wondering what you’ve done wrong. Instead, devote your precious time to attending networking events and spreading the word in person and via phone and email. For B2B software marketers the top sources of new business are organic search, SEM/PPC advertising, and word of mouth referrals [Capterra, 2013].</p>
<p>Don’t let your social network determine your worth to prospects, get out there and really engage them, then use these platforms to <strong>keep them interested</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lead generation is the primary objective of any <a title="B2B Marketing" href="/b2b-marketing-services/">B2B marketing</a> strategy. While the eventual objective is certainly sales, the sales process can be lengthy and begins with lead generation, lead nurturing and subsequent follow-ups.</p>
<p>There are many types of <a href="/lead-generation/">B2B lead generation</a> campaigns that a company can engage in. The premise or scope of lead generation has certainly evolved in recent years. Today, the different kinds of lead generation campaigns can be grouped in distinct categories, such as <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B content marketing</a>, direct mail, public relations, events, branding, phone calls, email, social media, online marketing, website and referrals.</p>
<p>These groups are in no particular order of importance. Every method is equally important. What matters is how a company uses these different types of lead generation campaigns. To further illustrate every category, here’s what a company should be doing or working on in each type of lead generation campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Content marketing should encompass articles, blogs, podcasts, e-books, video, speaking, info-graphics, meme, videos, guides, book reviews, case studies, research and original data, interviews and how-to content.</li>
<li>Direct mail must encompass self mailers, postcards, dimensional mails and personal letters.</li>
<li>Phone calls must cater to identification and verification of contacts, developing relationships, gaining internal referrals, uncovering business needs, opt-in for content notification, identifying sales ready leads, inviting companies to upcoming events and reengaging past opportunities.</li>
<li>Emails should be in the form of one-to-one, one-to-many and newsletters.</li>
<li>Social media engagement should encompass podcasts, video marketing through YouTube and Vimeo, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Public relations activities must include editorials, public speaking, press releases, contents such as white paper, news coverage and article placement.</li>
<li>Online marketing should include organic search, paid search or pay per click advertising, newsletter, sponsorships, banners, portals and online directories.</li>
<li>Websites should account for search engine optimization, landing pages, pay-per-click campaigns, blog and RSS.</li>
<li>Events must include seminars, workshops, webinars, teleseminar, conferences, tradeshows and executive briefings.</li>
<li>Branding must attend to advertising, sponsorships, associations, newsletters and events.</li>
<li>Referrals should entail vendors, consultants, customers and partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lead Generation is more than just cold-calling. The right lead generation campaigns will depend on a strategy that considers a range of characteristics unique to you, including your industry, your value proposition, your product or service and your target audience. It’s important to think outside the square: there are so many ways to generate leads, you just have to determine which are the most effective.</p>
<p>There may be varying degrees of focus on specific types of campaigns. The results from each category would also vary for companies depending on the nature of the products being marketed and the target audience. But all these types of business marketing strategies should be considered by every company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your business website is a potent tool for lead generation campaigns. Today, any business marketing strategy would require a website, whether it is <a title="B2B Marketing Services" href="/b2b-marketing-services/">B2B marketing</a> or B2C. For <a href="/lead-generation/">B2B lead generation</a> a website may not appear to be the ideal gateway but it can be made one. As consumers would search online for solutions to their problems, businesses too would look for the products and services they need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Websites have become the most effective tool to promote, educate and influence prospects as well as being a great and easy way to showcase what you have to offer. But, that would only work if your website can be found. If no one gets to your website or comes across it, then it is just another redundant asset.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can work on your website lead generation campaigns. Here are some tips to help you perfect the strategy.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>SEO is not a myth, but it’s not simple.</strong> Your website should be optimized for all search engines (understandably everyone focuses on Google, but their dominance is being eroded by Social Media and change in the search engine market). You should target a range of keywords and aim to get your website should appear on the first page of search engine results when prospective buyers or enquirers are looking up for the products or services you offer. Search engine optimization will help you to be visible on online results and that would generate some traffic. Without online traffic, a website cannot be used for lead generation campaigns. Learn more about <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-seo/">B2B SEO</a> strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Organic search engine optimization will not work in isolation.</strong> If you invest solely in search engine optimization, then you may have to wait a really long time before you see any rewards. More importantly, you may never get the desired results. A company has to invest in paid search engine marketing, such as pay per click advertising. Not only does this reap immediate rewards, it goes a long way to help test your SEO keywords.</li>
<li><strong>Online exposure and outreach are two foundation stones of website <a title="Lead Generation" href="/lead-generation/">lead generation campaigns</a>.</strong> Online exposure would be created with content. A company needs to have a content marketing strategy which will not only facilitate inbound marketing and thus traffic but it would also establish a company as an authority on the products or services that are being offered. Outreach can be attained by social media marketing and email marketing. Reaching out to a target audience, interacting with relevant groups on social media, targeting prospective leads with emails and following up on all would be essential in lead generation campaigns using the company website. Learn more about <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">B2B social media marketing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on conversions.</strong> Optimizing your website for keywords is one thing, but it’s just as important to focus on your website’s conversion strategy and conversion rates. When people visit your website, what do you get them to do to reach out to you? Contact forms, free downloads, newsletters and surveys are just some of the ways you can try to engage with your website visitors. In the end, there’s no point getting people to your website if they never come back or interact with you again. Picking the keywords and conversions tools that are the most successful to engage your visitors is the ultimate goal.</li>
