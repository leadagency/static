										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">Social media marketing, the 3 words which have completely changed the landscape of B2C marketing forever, but where does this leave us B2B marketers and is it worthwhile including a social media campaign into the marketing mix?</p>
<p>Social media marketing budgets almost doubled, worldwide, between 2014 and 2016 (increasing from $16 Billion USD to $31 Billion USD 2014-2016 – <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-advertising-stats/">Hootsuite 2016</a>), it is past the time where businesses are able to ignore their social marketing strategy and spend, and most certainly need to start paying very close attention to the leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Now, despite the massive increase in social media marketing interest and spend, 85% of B2B marketers haven’t been able to show a quantitative impact on their business as a direct result of social media spend (<a href="http://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2017/01/24/who-has-the-biggest-marketing-budgets/">The CMO Survey 2016</a>). This is a clear indicator of businesses treating social media the same as they have treated traditional media sources for so long,  that is, throwing a massive wad of cash at an ideas board and hoping something sticks.</p>
<p>A large percentage of companies are assuming that, by spending more money and blasting ads in front of as many people as possible, they will get greater returns on their marketing spend, but as shown in the results from the CMO survey, this could not be further from the truth.</p>
<p><a href="/11-social-hacks-to-improve-your-b2b-networking-skills/">Social media marketing</a> is all about getting a great ROI, and having the ability to turn a small spend into a massive return. To do this, companies need to be more creative with their campaigns, and put themselves in front of their customers where and when the customer is actually engaged and caring.</p>
<h4>Strategy &#8211; Influencer Marketing</h4>
<p><em>Influencer Marketing is centred around the theory that there is a much greater chance that a person will buy something when it has been recommended by someone they trust.</em></p>
<p>More than 90% of all consumers trust earned media, I.e. word of mouth, more than any other types of marketing collateral (Nielson Report 2017). However, the next closest avenue for marketers is to employ thought leaders and industry influencers. For example, if you are selling the world&#8217;s best processor, a customer is far more likely to trust the word, or endorsement, of a 3<sup>rd</sup> party expert in the field, say Bill Gates, as opposed to an advertisement from your business saying the exact same thing. This is as true for B2B marketers as it is for B2C marketers.</p>
<h4>Best Practice</h4>
<p>One B2B company that has been able to make the most from influencer marketing is American Express. AMEX collaborated with Grace Bonney and her team at Design*Sponge, as well as cable’s HGTV host  Emily Henderson to design engaging Amex branded decals. These decals were designed to resonate with small merchants, and encourage and incentivise those businesses to display the decals in their business, and then share the results on social media.</p>
<p>This campaign generated over 5 million impressions, but most importantly, earned over 50,000 social engagements from small business owners (<a href="http://shortyawards.com/8th/love-my-store-campaign">Shorty Awards 2015</a>). These 50,000 engagements all acted as a type of influencer marketing for other business owners who were not currently offering Amex in their establishments. As a result Amex saw a huge increase in interest in their product from small businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding B2B social media can be challenging. Research brands that are flourishing on social media and the chances are the first ten companies you stumble across are B2C companies. You&#8217;ll rarely hear about an HR consultancy going viral on Instagram or a rubber manufacturer crushing it on Facebook.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that B2B companies cannot be successful on <a href="/3-keys-to-unlocking-your-b2b-social-media-potential/">social media</a> &#8211; flourishing social media pages for B2B exist. The only thing is, they are a minority&#8230;. but that&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>That means there is a gap in the industry for B2B representation on social media. It also means that the B2B social media market is NOT saturated therefore, your business has less competitors online.</p>
<p>The following contains 5 social media strategies and best practices that will aid your B2B business online:</p>
<h3>1. Get on Social Media</h3>
<p>Seems straightforward enough but so many B2B companies are still shying away from using social media. &#8220;But I work in a boring industry&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; that my friend, is where you&#8217;re wrong. An example of an industry that may be considered &#8216;boring&#8217; but is doing great on social media is Xerox. They sell document solutions and technologies but have over 9 million views across their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/XeroxCorp?&amp;ab_channel=Xerox">Youtube Channel</a>. Their videos on digital printing and document solutions were a hit!</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t shy away from using social media. Use this tool to grow your business and connect with the public and potential clients.</p>
<p><em>Related: <a href="/changing-face-b2b-marketing/">The Changing Face of B2B Marketing</a></em></p>
<h3>2. Two birds with One Stone: Consistency &amp; Involvement</h3>
<p>Consistency is key! But who&#8217;s got the time? It can be overwhelming to come up with new, consistent and quality content every day or every week so it&#8217;s best to get the team involved! Give your employees the opportunity to have their voices heard and their work stories shared. Your employees can do this in various ways such as sharing how they got into their field, what they do in the company and why it is important or providing tips and strategies or best practices for their line of work.</p>
<p>Getting your employees involved in creating content online can also benefit company relationships as your employees will feel more valued and heard. They will also be more likely to share the company&#8217;s social media sites as they may want to show their family and friends that they were featured</p>
<p>Remember: customers always prefer a personal approach so, involving your employees in this creative process will humanize your business as your social media audience will get a glimpse of the people behind the company.</p>
<h3>3. Get Engaged!</h3>
<p>Speaking of personal approach,  it is also important to engage with your customers or potential customers on social media. Making that human connection is key in creating and maintaining relationships with clients. Social media allows B2B companies to create these connections efficiently but without cutting corners.</p>
<p>Support your clients by engaging in their content! As a B2B company, they may also struggle with the challenges of social media therefore, they will appreciate your engagement in their content. Follow them on social media and like, share and comment on their posts, articles and pictures.</p>
<p>When other companies or individuals engage with your posts on social media, be sure to like or reply in effort to show appreciation and demonstrate your company&#8217;s customer service quality.</p>
<h3>4. Develop a Presence</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of B2B companies online treat social media as an afterthought and therefore publish content that are lacking in personality. You don&#8217;t need to be a twitter troll or be overly obnoxious or edgy to be entertaining online. You do however, need to sound like an actual human rather than an automated robot online &#8212; people want to connect with people!</p>
<p>You can do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using conversational tone and language ~hold off on the jargon and engage in language that most people will understand. Not everyone will know about the &#8216;Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory&#8217; that your client may be trying to market however, more people might understand it if you describe it as a &#8216;personality test&#8217;, a &#8216;psychology test&#8217; or even a &#8216;psychometric test&#8217;.</li>
<li>Make Conversation ~ Social media isn&#8217;t just about broadcasting your message&#8230; it&#8217;s about connecting! So connect with your audience. Don&#8217;t be afraid to start a conversation with them (whether they are happy or angry). In 2013,<a href="http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2013-social-media-benchmark-study"> 67%</a> of consumers used company social media sites for service updates and inquiries while <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2012/state-of-the-media-the-social-media-report-2012.html">33%</a> of people prefer to contact businesses on <a href="/3-keys-to-unlocking-your-b2b-social-media-potential/">social media</a> relative to the telephone. Thus, interaction is still better than neglect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Expand Outside of LinkedIn</h3>
<p>While LinkedIn has been ranked as the most effective platform for B2B businesses, you don&#8217;t need to limit your business to one platform. Generating leads should not be your only focus as branding and brand loyalty are also important. Other B2B marketers have realized this and are <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-industry-report-2015/">expanding outside of LinkedIn</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media can be a powerful B2B marketing tool. By maintaining the right image online you can instil confidence in your business, discover more about your stakeholders and position yourself better in your market. So, after doing our research, we’ve decided to share with you our top six <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">B2B social media</a> strategies to benefit your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><em> Show off your employees</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-staff.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4282" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-staff.png" alt="employees" width="280" height="241" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-staff.png 534w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-staff-300x258.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a></p>
<p>Your employees are important to you. After all, they are what keeps the cogs of your business turning. So why not share the love?</p>
<p><a href="http://keyhole.co/blog/15-b2b-social-media-strategy-tips-best-practice-examples/">Introduce your online audience</a> to your employers. This can be as simple as a few regular posts with photos featuring your employees. As an example, ask them to share a little about what they do, what they love and what inspires them when they come into work.</p>
<p>Not only does this humanise your business, but it demonstrates the value your employees have within the organisation. This one of our top B2B business social media strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h4><em> Research your Competition</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-research.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4283 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-research.png" alt="research competition" width="600" height="400" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-research.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-research-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>B2B social media isn’t just about putting your brand out there, it can be a powerful research tool as well.</p>
<p>Find your competitors online and start monitoring their social media channels. Using social media monitoring tools like <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000176053&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.au%2F&amp;type=2">Salesforce</a> can reveal useful information to help optimise your posts.</p>
<p>Look at what types of posts yield the highest engagement – factors might include post length, hashtags, and sharing times. Take their successes and failures and use them to your advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h4><em> Find out more about your customers</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-customers.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4284 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-customers.png" alt="Find out more about customers" width="470" height="219" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-customers.png 470w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-customers-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>
<p>In Marketing and Communication it’s important to know your audience. Use social media to paint a picture of your ideal customers by creating <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/everything-marketers-need-to-research-create-detailed-buyer-personas-template.aspx">Buyer Personas</a>.</p>
<p>You can build a Buyer Persona by simply opening up a spreadsheet and starting a sample database of social media users. By each user add their age, gender, position, industry and other relevant information.</p>
<p>In the process of researching your customers, you might also uncover some feedback that can strengthen your business. Inevitably this kind of activity can only help you understand your customers better!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h4><em> Invest in your B2B social media content</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4285 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content.jpg" alt="Invest in your B2B social media content" width="5000" height="3328" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content.jpg 5000w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 5000px) 100vw, 5000px" /></a></p>
<p>Another of our key B2B social media strategies is investing in your content.</p>
<p>As social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have become more commercialised, organic posts have increasingly less reach. If you want to be heard you need to be willing to allocate money to boost your top performing posts.</p>
<p>Advertising on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram gets more sophisticated with each year. Not only can you boost posts, but you can target specific markets and locations with increasing accuracy.</p>
<p>Relate it back to the bottom line and find out how much is the right amount for your business to invest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h4><em> Optimise your Call to Actions</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-cta.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4286 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-cta.jpg" alt="Optimise your Call to Actions" width="338" height="302" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-cta.jpg 338w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-cta-300x268.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /></a></p>
<p>A strong call to action (CTA) is the key to generating higher CTRs. Social media scientist and author, Dan Zarrella, conducted research on Twitter in 2012 and discovered that adverbs and verbs make more impact than nouns or adjectives.</p>
<p>This is backed up by several content writers from the last few decades, from author Marina Calderone to educator and speaker Patti Digh.</p>
<p>In order to optimise your engagement, avoid posting weak CTAs with passive verbs. After all, it’s doubtful Nike would have gotten far with a slogan like, “Make sure it gets done.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h4><em>Join a group or start one</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4287 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups.jpg" alt="Join a group or start one" width="793" height="410" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups.jpg 793w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups-300x155.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups-768x397.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/social-media-for-b2b/">Groups and communities</a> on Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn provide an excellent opportunity to reach users interested in your industry.</p>
<p>Answering questions and posting useful content on these pages is great for networking and building a reputation. You are an expert it in your field so why not share some of that knowledge – you never know what kind of friends you might make!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these tactics out for yourself and let us know what worked (and what didn’t work) for you. We love to hear from you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business-to-business marketing (or B2B marketing, as it is often called) involves the sale of one company’s product or service to another company.</p>
<p>Whilst it comes as no surprise that the B2B marketing ecosphere is changing, there have been some noteworthy shifts in <strong><u>how</u></strong> B2B purchasing decisions are happening, but also <strong><u>who is</u></strong> responsible for influencing them.</p>
<p>Google has paid particular attention to the changing landscape of B2B since 2012 and recently carried out a survey of around 3,000 B2B researchers about their research and buying habits – along with their use of digital (specifically mobile, search and video content).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/research-studies/evolving-path-of-todays-tech-b2b-customer.html">findings</a> demystified a number of widely held misconceptions and made a strong case for re-thinking current B2B marketing strategies. Whilst it mimics certain trends in digital marketing at a macro level, there are some unique observations or &#8220;aahhh&#8221; moments.</p>
<p>Here’s the top 5 myths revealed in the findings which every B2B marketer should know:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">MYTH 1: Millennials aren&#8217;t making B2B business decisions</span></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>REALITY: Nearly 75% of all B2B decision makers are millennials</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a dramatic shift since 2012 in the B2B buyer and researcher demographic.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, there was a pretty even mix across age groups. In 2014, however, millennial researchers accounted for around 50%. This trend has continued with millennials accounting for about 75% of researchers in 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3251" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers.jpg" alt="millenial decision influencers" width="1024" height="768" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers-800x600.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></h3>
<h3></h3>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">MYTH 2: B2B marketing should target the highest-level executives</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>REALITY: B2B researchers, rather than top-level executives, have most influence over purchase decisions.</strong></span></h3>
<p>B2B marketing strategies focussing on senior-level executives won’t nearly be as effective today as they were four years ago due to the dramatic change in influence over the final decision making.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3249" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers-2.jpg" alt="millenial decison makers" width="1024" height="768" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers-2.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers-2-300x225.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers-2-768x576.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/03/of-Millenial-Decision-Makers-2-800x600.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />In comparison, a recent study from <a href="https://madewithmerit.com/">Sacunas</a>,  B2B research specialists, revealed that in 2016, over 73% of millennials were involved in some form of B2B decision-making, with 33% being sole decision makers in their business .</p>
<h3></h3>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">MYTH 3: Branded searches should be the focus of your search strategy</span></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>REALITY: 71% of B2B researchers start their research with a generic search</strong></span></h3>
<p>The Google survey also revealed that B2B researchers did <strong>12 searches</strong> prior to engaging on a specific brand and that they were already <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/b2b-digital-evolution.html">57% along the path</a> to a decision before even performing an action on your site.</p>
<p>Therefore, a significant opportunity exits for B2B marketers ( and in particular smaller businesses) to capture the attention of researchers <strong>before</strong> they engage branded results.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">MYTH 4: Not many B2B researchers use mobile</span></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>REALITY: Mobile dominates search with nearly 60% usage in 2016.</strong></span></h3>
<p>The trend towards mobile based searches is shifting so rapidly in fact that Google started rolling out its <a href="http://searchengineland.com/faq-google-mobile-first-index-262751">mobile-first index</a>  late last year. This means Google will create and rank its search listings based on the mobile version of content, even for listings that are shown to desktop users. They plan to eventually switch exclusively to mobile indexation, even for desktop searches.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">MYTH 5: Video is watched solely to gain awareness</span></h2>
<h4></h4>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>REALITY: B2B researchers watch video during the entire path to purchase</strong></span></h3>
<p>Over 70% of B2B researchers and decision makers are watching videos throughout their purchasing process. That&#8217;s an astounding 52% jump in only two years.</p>
<p>Videos can either be seen as an extension to the conversation or an alternative means of consuming content instead of reading. A 2 minute video can often contain more valuable information than a 10 minute read &#8211; which is why <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/collections/micromoments.html">Micro-Moments</a>  are exciting marketers more than ever.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;">Who are millennials?</span></h2>
<p>The millennial generation are true digital natives and unlike any other that came before it.</p>
<p>The oldest members of the group were born around 1980, and that means they&#8217;ve never known a world without the modern-day internet.</p>
<p>When millennials joined the work-force, <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2011/08/09/search-and-email-still-top-the-list-of-most-popular-online-activities/">half of all Australian’s were using email regularly</a>, BlackBerrys had been the coolest handheld device on the market for several years and online search engines were already a part of daily life, not forgetting that Yahoo was “crushing it”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered if Facebook has been reading your mind? Since that one day you searched for DIY wedding invitations, there have been advertisements popping up all over the place with tips and tricks for getting married on a budget. Your feed is full of low-price wedding dresses and sales on honeymoon destinations. You knew Facebook was all-powerful, but you didn’t know it was all-knowing too. Thank goodness, it is not. It is simply making brilliant use of Marketing Automation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2011/09/27/customers-dont-want-to-talk-to-you-either/">Forbes</a>, our interactions with the companies with whom we have a relationship is decreasing so much that in just five years, we will likely have no human interaction with them at all. The value of quick and accurate responses to customer questions/complaints has only gone up over the years. And if a business can provide the right solution before the consumer even starts looking, so much the better.</p>
<h2>Marketing Automation Improves Everyday Marketing</h2>
<p>Marketing Automation allows for all of these things. It takes much of the guesswork out of strategising new marketing plans and finding new clients. Those businesses that use it are 25% more likely to know the right clients to approach, and how to approach them, than those with no automated system. Companies that employ Marketing Automation have shown up to an incredible <a href="http://www.b2bmarketing.net/blog/posts/2014/06/10/marketing-automation-facts-speak-themselves">451% rise in qualified leads</a>.</p>
<p>Marketing Automation software designers such as <a href="http://www.marketo.com/about/">Marketo</a> believe that automated market research in the digital age is best done through channels that the average person uses every day: social media, news websites, blogs, and search engines. The marketing team is then responsible to practice engagement marketing, building relationships with the client in order to ensure continuing business and genuine connection.</p>
<h2>Marketing Automation Improves B2B Marketing</h2>
<p>Marketing Automation saves considerable amounts of time and money that can then be used to make stronger, more effective marketing plans. As an added bonus, the automated system performs the necessary tasks with more efficiency and accuracy. Win, win, and win. Rather than replacing the need for people on the job, Marketing Automation exists to perform the boring, time-consuming tasks of market research and information acquisition, freeing up the minds of marketing professionals to be creative and develop positive relationships with clients.</p>
<p>While convenient enough for Business-to-Consumer marketing, Marketing Automation is practically a necessity for contemporary Business-to-Business marketing. Businesses represent a much wider range of needs, demographics, and preferences. They produce a greater amount of data that must be collected and analysed in order to form an accurate idea of how they can be successfully marketed to. Businesses thrive when the market can be predicted, and the solution is simpler than ever.</p>
<p>Leave the mind-reading to the computers, and open up your marketing team to build meaningful relationships with the clients you know are looking.</p>
