										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">Social media marketing, the 3 words which have completely changed the landscape of B2C marketing forever, but where does this leave us B2B marketers and is it worthwhile including a social media campaign into the marketing mix?</p>
<p>Social media marketing budgets almost doubled, worldwide, between 2014 and 2016 (increasing from $16 Billion USD to $31 Billion USD 2014-2016 – <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-advertising-stats/">Hootsuite 2016</a>), it is past the time where businesses are able to ignore their social marketing strategy and spend, and most certainly need to start paying very close attention to the leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Now, despite the massive increase in social media marketing interest and spend, 85% of B2B marketers haven’t been able to show a quantitative impact on their business as a direct result of social media spend (<a href="http://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2017/01/24/who-has-the-biggest-marketing-budgets/">The CMO Survey 2016</a>). This is a clear indicator of businesses treating social media the same as they have treated traditional media sources for so long,  that is, throwing a massive wad of cash at an ideas board and hoping something sticks.</p>
<p>A large percentage of companies are assuming that, by spending more money and blasting ads in front of as many people as possible, they will get greater returns on their marketing spend, but as shown in the results from the CMO survey, this could not be further from the truth.</p>
<p><a href="/11-social-hacks-to-improve-your-b2b-networking-skills/">Social media marketing</a> is all about getting a great ROI, and having the ability to turn a small spend into a massive return. To do this, companies need to be more creative with their campaigns, and put themselves in front of their customers where and when the customer is actually engaged and caring.</p>
<h4>Strategy &#8211; Influencer Marketing</h4>
<p><em>Influencer Marketing is centred around the theory that there is a much greater chance that a person will buy something when it has been recommended by someone they trust.</em></p>
<p>More than 90% of all consumers trust earned media, I.e. word of mouth, more than any other types of marketing collateral (Nielson Report 2017). However, the next closest avenue for marketers is to employ thought leaders and industry influencers. For example, if you are selling the world&#8217;s best processor, a customer is far more likely to trust the word, or endorsement, of a 3<sup>rd</sup> party expert in the field, say Bill Gates, as opposed to an advertisement from your business saying the exact same thing. This is as true for B2B marketers as it is for B2C marketers.</p>
<h4>Best Practice</h4>
<p>One B2B company that has been able to make the most from influencer marketing is American Express. AMEX collaborated with Grace Bonney and her team at Design*Sponge, as well as cable’s HGTV host  Emily Henderson to design engaging Amex branded decals. These decals were designed to resonate with small merchants, and encourage and incentivise those businesses to display the decals in their business, and then share the results on social media.</p>
<p>This campaign generated over 5 million impressions, but most importantly, earned over 50,000 social engagements from small business owners (<a href="http://shortyawards.com/8th/love-my-store-campaign">Shorty Awards 2015</a>). These 50,000 engagements all acted as a type of influencer marketing for other business owners who were not currently offering Amex in their establishments. As a result Amex saw a huge increase in interest in their product from small businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding B2B social media can be challenging. Research brands that are flourishing on social media and the chances are the first ten companies you stumble across are B2C companies. You&#8217;ll rarely hear about an HR consultancy going viral on Instagram or a rubber manufacturer crushing it on Facebook.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that B2B companies cannot be successful on <a href="/3-keys-to-unlocking-your-b2b-social-media-potential/">social media</a> &#8211; flourishing social media pages for B2B exist. The only thing is, they are a minority&#8230;. but that&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>That means there is a gap in the industry for B2B representation on social media. It also means that the B2B social media market is NOT saturated therefore, your business has less competitors online.</p>
<p>The following contains 5 social media strategies and best practices that will aid your B2B business online:</p>
<h3>1. Get on Social Media</h3>
<p>Seems straightforward enough but so many B2B companies are still shying away from using social media. &#8220;But I work in a boring industry&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; that my friend, is where you&#8217;re wrong. An example of an industry that may be considered &#8216;boring&#8217; but is doing great on social media is Xerox. They sell document solutions and technologies but have over 9 million views across their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/XeroxCorp?&amp;ab_channel=Xerox">Youtube Channel</a>. Their videos on digital printing and document solutions were a hit!</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t shy away from using social media. Use this tool to grow your business and connect with the public and potential clients.</p>
<p><em>Related: <a href="/changing-face-b2b-marketing/">The Changing Face of B2B Marketing</a></em></p>
<h3>2. Two birds with One Stone: Consistency &amp; Involvement</h3>
<p>Consistency is key! But who&#8217;s got the time? It can be overwhelming to come up with new, consistent and quality content every day or every week so it&#8217;s best to get the team involved! Give your employees the opportunity to have their voices heard and their work stories shared. Your employees can do this in various ways such as sharing how they got into their field, what they do in the company and why it is important or providing tips and strategies or best practices for their line of work.</p>
<p>Getting your employees involved in creating content online can also benefit company relationships as your employees will feel more valued and heard. They will also be more likely to share the company&#8217;s social media sites as they may want to show their family and friends that they were featured</p>
<p>Remember: customers always prefer a personal approach so, involving your employees in this creative process will humanize your business as your social media audience will get a glimpse of the people behind the company.</p>
<h3>3. Get Engaged!</h3>
<p>Speaking of personal approach,  it is also important to engage with your customers or potential customers on social media. Making that human connection is key in creating and maintaining relationships with clients. Social media allows B2B companies to create these connections efficiently but without cutting corners.</p>
<p>Support your clients by engaging in their content! As a B2B company, they may also struggle with the challenges of social media therefore, they will appreciate your engagement in their content. Follow them on social media and like, share and comment on their posts, articles and pictures.</p>
<p>When other companies or individuals engage with your posts on social media, be sure to like or reply in effort to show appreciation and demonstrate your company&#8217;s customer service quality.</p>
<h3>4. Develop a Presence</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of B2B companies online treat social media as an afterthought and therefore publish content that are lacking in personality. You don&#8217;t need to be a twitter troll or be overly obnoxious or edgy to be entertaining online. You do however, need to sound like an actual human rather than an automated robot online &#8212; people want to connect with people!</p>
<p>You can do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using conversational tone and language ~hold off on the jargon and engage in language that most people will understand. Not everyone will know about the &#8216;Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory&#8217; that your client may be trying to market however, more people might understand it if you describe it as a &#8216;personality test&#8217;, a &#8216;psychology test&#8217; or even a &#8216;psychometric test&#8217;.</li>
<li>Make Conversation ~ Social media isn&#8217;t just about broadcasting your message&#8230; it&#8217;s about connecting! So connect with your audience. Don&#8217;t be afraid to start a conversation with them (whether they are happy or angry). In 2013,<a href="http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2013-social-media-benchmark-study"> 67%</a> of consumers used company social media sites for service updates and inquiries while <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2012/state-of-the-media-the-social-media-report-2012.html">33%</a> of people prefer to contact businesses on <a href="/3-keys-to-unlocking-your-b2b-social-media-potential/">social media</a> relative to the telephone. Thus, interaction is still better than neglect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Expand Outside of LinkedIn</h3>
<p>While LinkedIn has been ranked as the most effective platform for B2B businesses, you don&#8217;t need to limit your business to one platform. Generating leads should not be your only focus as branding and brand loyalty are also important. Other B2B marketers have realized this and are <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-industry-report-2015/">expanding outside of LinkedIn</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve read all the articles and you’ve listened to all the experts. You know that social media marketing is a key component of the B2B sales process – then how come you aren’t seeing the results you were hoping for?</p>
<p>Well, all those social media advocates weren’t wrong &#8211; social media marketing (SMM) is a key marketing and lead-nurturing tool. Just look at the statistics below.</p>
<ol>
<li>83% of B2B marketers use social media; making it the most common B2B marketing tactic (<a href="http://www.targetmarketingmag.com/post/death-salesman/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BVm7MI5EoSVmvkR%2BS8QvFvA%3D%3D">Source</a>)</li>
<li>More than 70% of all B2B marketers use at least one of the “Big 4” social media sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube) to distribute content (<a href="http://b2bprblog.marxcommunications.com/b2bpr/top-b2b-pr-mistakes-to-avoid?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BVm7MI5EoSVmvkR%2BS8QvFvA%3D%3D">Source</a>)</li>
<li>54% of B2B marketers said they’ve generated leads from social media (<a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20150624T211502__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Industries_15/Accenture-B2B-Procurement-Study.pdf">Source</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>So what is your B2B company doing wrong? You’ve followed the guidelines, you’re on all the most popular platforms, and you are regularly sharing content; yet you still can’t gain any traction. Find out below some of the most common reasons why B2B companies fail at social media marketing.</p>
<h2>Five Reasons Why Social Media Marketing May Not Be For You</h2>
<p>Social media is only a little over a decade old. As a result, its ‘shiny and new’ status has captured the imaginations of millions of entrepreneurs and marketers around the world – spouting endless articles and discussions online, in universities, at business events, and in boardrooms.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is blasphemous to say social media doesn’t work for your business. You could be labeled a ‘luddite’ or your views as ‘antiquated’. But, in reality, social media doesn’t work for 100% of businesses 100% of the time.</p>
<p>There are five questions you need to consider before investing heavily in social media.</p>
<h3>1.     Does Your Target Audience Use Social Media?</h3>
<p><a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">Social media</a> may not be as ubiquitous as you think. Only 24% of small businesses in 2017 found social media important in acquiring new customers; whilst over 51% said they saw little to no benefit to their bottom line according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/321704/us-small-business-social-media-usage/">Statistica</a>.</p>
<p>The B2B buyer journey is a complex one, requiring different messaging to each of the different stakeholders that play a role in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Although social media might engage a younger millennial workforce; it may do little to engage an older upper management demographic who have grown up without it.</p>
<p>Social media is limited by who is on it. In B2B SMM, you are relying on the social media users in a company to filter the information up to the decision makers.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4419 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="Target Audience using Social Media" width="864" height="544" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png 864w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1-300x189.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1-768x484.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /></p>
<h3>2.     Will Your Messaging Work On Social Media?</h3>
<p>Social media is transient – very little of your company messaging will stick with customers. You only have to look at YouTube, with its five-second ad windows, to see how difficult it is to get your message across.</p>
<p>Social media relies on a constant stream of content. Many marketers will advocate that you have up to six seconds to win over your prospect with your message – this isn’t much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/278922">Recent Nueromarketing research</a> indicates your impulsive ‘reptilian brain’ takes precedence over your rational decision-making neocortex processes; even in B2B purchases. As a result, you may have less than a second to make a real impression on a viewer.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of B2B products and services and their delivery, it is hard to convey those types of messages using a channel like social media.</p>
<h3>3.     Do You Have A Solid Online Sales Funnel?</h3>
<p>Social media is a great way to drive engagement and awareness of your product; however, engagement and awareness aren’t good enough if they don’t lead to sales.</p>
<p>Having a well developed website, with clear and enticing calls to action, should be your first consideration.</p>
<p>Consider your online sales funnel like a body of freshwater thawing its way down a mountain into a freshwater lake. Your social media is the snowy peak; it is very early on in the process. Your funnel is the series of glaciers, rivers and wetlands that lead to your figurative ‘lake of sales’. The better you establish your funnel the more of that snow is going to find it’s way to you.</p>
<p>Understanding the sales funnel can be complex. There are many ways to measure and evaluate your marketing activities. In the past, many marketers traditionally attributed the success of a campaign to whatever activity led to a sale – this was known as ‘single-source attribution’. However, with the advent of analytics and advanced measurement tools, the value of the marketing mix as a whole has gained a lot of traction.</p>
<p>In team sports, such as basketball, the players that are assisting are just as valuable as those making the shots. The same is true of modern marketing. Today, marketers attribute success to many channels and activities – this form of marketing is known as ‘multi-touch attribution’.</p>
<p>For an overview of multi-touch attribution follow this link – <a href="mailto:/b2b-marketing-attribution-how-single-source-attribution-is-hurting-your-business/">B2B Marketing Attribution – How Single Source Attribution Is Hurting Your Business</a>.</p>
<h3>4.     Do You The Have Time and Resources For Social Media?</h3>
<p>Depending on the size of your business you might find that managing several social media accounts can be time-consuming, especially if you are one of many people who see social media as a chore and not a pleasure.</p>
<p>Having some form of social media is important. Even if you aren’t constantly updating it, setting up a Facebook and/or LinkedIn account with as much information as possible can be highly valuable to your potential customers.</p>
<p>Depending on your industry, finding content can be difficult. Don’t use up all your best stuff straight away; be sure to spread it out.</p>
<p>Minimise your commitment till you have the time to work on it or the resources to have someone assist you with it.</p>
<h3>5.     Is There A Better Way To Spend Your Marketing Dollars?</h3>
<p>Social media and other online channels can seem like easy ways to spend your marketing dollars. At the click of a button you can get your message out to thousands or even millions of people.</p>
<p>However, depending on your product, brand and target audience, spending that money on an ad in your local newspaper could bring in a much greater ROI.</p>
<h2>Eight Insights to Better Your Social Media Marketing Efforts</h2>
<p>So, you are convinced social platforms is the right channel for your business; yet, your posts go unliked, your followers will not engage with you and you’ve sunk a lot of money on sponsored content with little return.</p>
<p>Below are six lessons to guide you in your B2B social efforts. Find out what you are doing wrong, and how you can make SMM more meaningful and beneficial to you.</p>
<h3>1.     Perspective Is Key</h3>
<p>Before you can begin marketing your business properly on social media, you might need to re-evaluate your expectations. What outcomes do you want from your social activities?</p>
<p>Let’s be clear that social media is a fickle thing. You might prepare a campaign and you might do everything right, but there is no guarantee anyone will engage.</p>
<p>Returns from social media aren’t a straightforward matter of investing and seeing an equivalent pay off. Marketing on social platforms is more of a gamble. You have to be ‘in it to win it’ as they say.</p>
<p>You might have grown up in a world where your Twitter following had no impact on your sales; but the world is changing and social media has come out on top.</p>
<p>Think of SMM as more of a necessary expense, like insurance or start-up costs, which you need to keep your head above water in a sea of competitive businesses.</p>
<h3>2.     Have A Firm Strategy In Place</h3>
<p>As novelist and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once wrote, “A goal without a plan is a wish.”</p>
<p>Auditing your social media accounts and developing concrete goals for each is important. This planning process will also give you an idea about the type of content that your audience relates to.</p>
<p>Once you’ve established where you want to be and where you are now, you will be in a better position to discover the right tactics for your business</p>

<h3>3.     Remember Your ‘ABC’ Rule &#8211; Always Be Consistent!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.b2bnn.com/2017/09/five-reasons-b2b-companies-fail-content-social-media-marketing/">According to CMI research</a>, one of the major challenges for B2B marketers is maintain consistency in their content.</p>
<p>Finding the right voice for your brand on social media, and consistently using it, will help distinguish your business amongst all the other vying businesses online.</p>
<p>As platforms like Facebook are beginning to deprioritise pushy sales content, giving your audience a genuine reason to follow you will be more and more important.</p>
<p>Deciding amongst your administrators what types of hash tags, emoticons, grammar and style to use will help make your audience feel like they are conversing with your brand on a more human level.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4671 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/social-media.jpg" alt="Social Media Channels" width="800" height="380" /></p>
<h3>4.     Find The Right Channels</h3>
<p>Just because Facebook has over two billion users doesn’t mean you should be using it as your primary social media channel. Find the right channel to suit your industry and audience.</p>
<p>If your business is involved in fashion and textile for example, sites like Instagram may serve your business much more.</p>
<p>Think outside of the box as well. You may not have heard of social media platforms like <a href="https://untappd.com/">Untappd</a> or <a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a>, but these niche social sites have small but highly engaged users.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/account/login">Ravelry</a> is a social media network for crocheters and knitters. If you really want to engage with your customers, meet them on the sites they are likely to be.</p>
<p>Niche social media platforms are becoming increasingly popular. Find out what is out there and see if you can reach your target audience on these platforms.</p>
<h3>5.     Make Your Brand Exciting</h3>
<p>You can spend several hours a week working on your business’ social media sites, but see barely any movement in followers or engagement. This can be very discouraging, you may find yourself questioning the point of it all.</p>
<p>You look to other competitors and see how popular they are and wonder how they are achieving all that success?</p>
<p>The reality could be that <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/07/19/social-media-doesn-t-work-your-brand-because-your-brand-boring">your brand needs a refresh</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that it’s very hard to gauge what will make your brand exciting to your target audience. After all, ‘exciting’ is a relative term. And, to be clear, we aren’t suggesting that you follow the ‘cool’ brands by loading your content with irreverent hash-tags and pointless click-bait.</p>
<p>The real way to find what works is to experiment. Be bold and try and new ideas often. For some hot tips, read this article on <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/marketing-boring-brand-social-media">Marketing ‘Boring’ Brands On Social Media.</a></p>
<h3>6.     Synergise With Your Sales Team</h3>
<p><a href="/b2b-marketing-services/sales-marketing-efficiencies/">Marketing and sales</a> don’t like to be confused for one another, but it is understandable why people tend to amalgamate these two professions. Sales and marketing feed off each other.</p>
<p>With metrics and analytics being increasingly common, using a <a href="/b2b-marketing-attribution-how-single-source-attribution-is-hurting-your-business/">mixed attribution</a> system to measure the success of your marketing campaigns will help you understand what is and isn’t working much better.</p>
<p>Coordinate your marketing efforts and share data with your sales team. Find reliable ways to monitor you customers’ buyer journeys. This will give you an idea of what social media channels are going to work for you.</p>
<p>You may find that all that marketing on YouTube has had little effect and that you could be spending your money on advertising on Instagram for better results.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hopefully, some of these tips have helped you reconsider your social strategy. Perhaps, you have been relying on social media at the expense of other channels, or maybe your content just hasn’t connected just yet.</p>
<p>Creating value for your consumers is the only real way to convert users on social media. Keep experimenting, be bold and don’t be afraid to play around with your social media sites.</p>
