An example of A\/B Testing might be randomly serving visitors two different pages, and measuring the respective click-through rates of both pages.

Churn Rate  \/tʃəːn’reɪt\/ Noun    A percentage rate at which customers stop subscribing. This metric is used in B2B email marketing to determine how many customers are being lost on average per campaign. Your churn rate can indicate whether you should be sending off content more or less often, as well as many other insights.  Clickthrough Rate (CTR)  \/klɪk’θruː’reɪt\/ Noun    The metric that identifies the amount of visitors to a page who click a hyperlink compared to the number of visitors total.

Wordpress is one of the most popular forms of CMS. The whole point of building your website around a CMS is that it allows users to easily edit and change the website without having to trawl through endless code.  Content Marketing  \/kənˈtent ˈmɑː(r)kɪtɪŋ\/ Noun    Content Marketing is a marketing strategy that is focused on creating valuable, relevant and consistent content that is shared with the buyer across channels to educate them about how your company’s products or services can solve their particular problems.    ‘Content’ refers to any materials or pieces of information that are released by the company.

B2B content marketers create content that their target market finds to be valuable; this creates trust and authority. Content can bring in website traffic and lead customer to conversion, so it is often a vital part of a successful inbound marketing strategy.  Conversion  \/kənˈvɜː(r)ʃ(ə)n\/ Noun    A Conversion is typically counted when a prospect or lead performs a particular action that is valuable to the business. Conversions on a website actions can include clicking a button to download a resource, making a purchase or completing a lead form.  Conversion Path  \/kənˈvəːʃ(ə)n’pɑːθ\/ Noun    A description of the steps taken by an anonymous visitor towards becoming a verified lead. The conversion path is a complete description of the sales funnel and buyers journey. It is best thought of as a map of the path you want your visitors to go down.  Conversion Rate  \/kənˈvɜː(r)ʃ(ə)n reɪt\/ Noun    Conversion rate is the percentage of website visitors that convert into leads or actual customers. Pages with high conversion rates are performing well while pages with low conversion rates are performing poorly.

The conversion rate, of CVR, is a metric used to measure acquisitions and conversions. An example of this may be a lead magnet on a landing page.

Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO)  \/kənˈvəːʃ(ə)n’reɪt’ɒptɪmʌɪˈzeɪʃ(ə)n\/ Noun    Is the systematic and scientific process of increasing the likelihood of your website visitors to undertake a desired action. Conversion rate optimisation, or CRO, involves a range of activities, that may include A\/B testing, CTA optimisation or ad rotation, to name a few.  Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)  \/kɒst pɜː(r) ˌækwɪˈzɪʃ(ə)n\/Noun    Cost Per Acquisition refers to the total cost of converting someone into a customer. It is one of the most important metrics for any marketing department to consider as you need to ensure you’re not spending more money to convert a customer than they’re worth.  Cost Per Impression (CPM)  \/kɒst pɜː(r) ɪmˈpreʃ(ə)n\/ Noun    Cost Per Impression (CPM) is also known as Cost Per Mille, which is why it is abbreviated to CPM. “Mille” is a Latin word meaning “thousands”.  This term is used to quote the price per a thousand views of an advertisement displayed on a website page. For example, a $3 CPM would mean that for $3 your ad would get 1000 impressions.    In this advertising model, advertisers pay for the number of times the ad is displayed regardless of whether it is clicked on or not. Each appearance of the ad counts as an impression.  Cost-Per-Lead (CPL)  \/kɒst’pəːliːd\/ Noun    In simple terms, it is the financial value it costs your marketing organisation to acquire a lead.

Crowdsourced Content  \/ˈkraʊdsɔːsd’kənˈtɛnt\/ Noun    User generated content that is then edited and prepared to share. As marketing has become less of a one-way communication model and more two-way, interacting engaging with users has become a priority for many organisations.    User generated content allows your stakeholders to engage with your brand, and provide content that can be shared. This type of content is often much more effective as it comes directly from the audience you are trying to target, and makes your audience feel invested in your brand.  Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)  \/ˈkʌstəmə’ˌakwɪˈzɪʃ(ə)n’kɒst\/ Noun    Total Sales and Marketing cost divided by number of new customers acquired. If your customer acquisition cost, or CAC, is higher than your ROI, then you do not have a sustainable business model. By optimising your campaigns you may be able to lower your CAC over time.  Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  \/ˈkʌstəmə’rɪˈleɪʃ(ə)nʃɪpˈmanɪdʒm(ə)nt\/ Noun    Software that allows the management of relationships and interactions with customers and leads.

The strategy around demand generation includes promoting awareness of your product, positioning it as relevant in the minds of your customer and mitigating or reducing a customer’s need for evaluation.    The ultimate goal of demand generation is to build and nurture prospects and leads and turn them into long term customers. For this to be effective, marketers use a number of platforms, often combining several channels into one marketing program backed up by a structured sales process.  Direct Marketing  \/dɪˈrekt ˈmɑː(r)kɪtɪŋ\/    Direct marketing removes the “middle man” from the marketing process. Put simply, it is a marketing strategy where the business addresses potential customers on a more personal level than other forms of marketing. This means the company doesn’t put advertisements on the internet, on television, billboards or other forms of media that appeal to the general public. Instead they communicate directly to customers through channels such as: mail, telephone calls, text messages, emails, brochures, catalogs and other forms of advertising that are delivered directly to the customer.    Direct marketing messages generally include a call to action, encouraging the recipient to respond via a phone number, reply card or by clicking on a link in an email promotion. The effectiveness of a direct-marketing campaign is measured by tracking the call to action responses.  Dynamic Content  \/dʌɪˈnamɪk’kənˈtɛnt\/ Noun    Personalised content that changes depending on the the viewer. Dynamic content is being used more and more by marketers to personalise interactions with clients. A simple example maybe using cookies and location targeting to change the the name of the city referenced in an advertisement to refer to the user’s location.    More complex forms of dynamic content are being explored to optimise site content. Using machine learning, some companies are experimenting with changing the language of copy over time using A\/B testing to improve it over time in an automated fashion. This is only one or many ways dynamic content is being utilised by marketers across the globe.

User Experience (UX)  \/juːzə’ɪkˈspɪərɪəns\/ Noun    The overall experience an individual has with a particular brand, organisation or business. UX is shorthand for User eXperience and includes the strategy of considering and manipulating a user: from their discovery and awareness of the brand (usually via a website or app) all the way through their interactions including purchase, use, and even advocacy of that brand.

User Interface (UI)  \/juːzə’ɪk’ɪntəfeɪs\/ Noun    A form of user-to-technology interface that allows users to easily control a software application or hardware device.

It refers to ethical practices that improve site rankings on a search engine results page (SERP).  Techniques used in white hat SEO are within the guidelines stipulated by Google or other search engines, such as: creating original and quality content, implementing keyword research, securing relevant back links, and making your site easy to navigate. These techniques are aimed at getting constant high levels of organic search traffic.  White paper  \/ waɪt ˈpeɪpə(r) \/    A White Paper is an authoritative document intended to fully inform the reader about a particular subject. White papers are data-centric, text-heavy business documents that are typically longer than blog posts but shorter than ebooks. Due to the large amount of data and research needed in order to put them together, white papers are deep reads and tend to have a formal tone. They combine expert knowledge and research into a document that argues for a specific solution or recommendation. If they’re well-written, they’re powerful tools for solving problems, establishing authority, and generating leads.  Word-of-Mouth  \/wəːd’ɒv’maʊθ\/ Adjective    The passing of information, advice and brand advocacy from person-to-person. Word-of-mouth advertising is organic and the best way to gain leads.

Optimising your XML sitemap is a tactic employed for SEO purposes.        YouTube  \/ˈjuːtjuːb\/ Noun    A popular online video sharing platform. YouTube is owned by the same group that own Google.
