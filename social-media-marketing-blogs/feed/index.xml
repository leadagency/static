										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is becoming increasingly prominent in B2B marketing, with a growing number of individuals recognising the immense value it can offer their business.</p>
<p>With this in mind, if you’ve integrated social media into your company’s <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/">B2B digital marketing</a> strategy, you certainly aren’t alone. In fact, <a href="https://www.weidert.com/blog/statistics-about-b2b-social-media-usage">83% of B2B marketers</a> have now established a presence on social media sites, including <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/linkedin-marketing/">LinkedIn</a>, Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>With such a large number of B2B marketers looking to make an impact on social media, it’s not hard to see why so many also find it difficult to grow their company’s page and audience. Social media can, in many industries, be incredibly competitive. If you’re going to reach your full potential, you need a strong, realistic and well-thought-out B2B social media strategy.</p>
<p><em>But what if you’ve already developed a strategy, started implementing it and, for some reason, it isn’t working how you’d imagined?</em></p>
<h2>Getting Your B2B Social Media Marketing Strategy ‘Right’</h2>
<p>If your <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">B2B social media marketing</a> campaign isn’t getting momentum, it’s time to reign in on where exactly you’re missing the mark. Even if your existing campaign is performing relatively <em>well</em>, it could almost always be better.</p>
<p>Social media isn’t a ‘set and forget’ approach to B2B marketing. If you aren’t putting continued effort into growing your social channels and connecting with users, you’ll likely struggle to see the results you’re after.</p>
<p>The key – don’t get too comfortable.</p>
<p>Keep investigating new opportunities and fine-tuning your B2B business’ social media strategy and, in time, your goals will be well within your reach.</p>
<p>The first step in this process, of course, is pinpointing any downfalls in your current approach and, respectively, addressing them by actioning improvements as required.</p>
<h2>Common Mistakes Made in B2B Social Media Marketing</h2>
<p>If you’re ready to start refining your B2B business’ social media strategy, addressing the following common mistakes is a great place to start.</p>
<h4>Lack of a Clear Strategy</h4>
<p>While <a href="https://www.weidert.com/blog/statistics-about-b2b-social-media-usage">80% of B2B marketers</a> have a specific social media strategy, just 32% have it documented.</p>
<p>Whether you haven’t created a B2B social media strategy, it hasn’t been documented, or it <a href="https://www.walkersands.com/7-reasons-why-b2b-brands-fail-on-social-media/">simply isn’t clear</a> – there’s no better time to change that than now.</p>
<p>While this may seem pretty self-explanatory, many organisations fall into the trap of jumping headfirst into posting on social media without actually establishing direction beforehand. This can, consequently, result in their content lacking a clear purpose, sending inconsistent messages and becoming repetitive – all of which isn’t ideal when it comes to engaging and retaining the attention of users.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are numerous ways you can prepare your B2B business for success on social media platforms. At the core of this, you’ll need a comprehensive strategy guiding your efforts.</p>
<p>When developing a B2B social media strategy, you’ll likely benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conducting research and collating insights regarding <em>what </em>your audience is actually interested in;</li>
<li>Deciding on and specifying the types of content you intend to post;</li>
<li>Determining a budget for a specified timeframe;</li>
<li>Setting realistic, time-specific goals;</li>
<li>Creating a clear plan of action.</li>
</ul>
<p>By recording all of this information, you can ensure that all of those involved are on the same page, while also improving consistency between social and alternative channels your B2B business is using.</p>
<h4>Low-Quality Content</h4>
<p>If you’re using social media, regardless of the platform – what kind of content do you gravitate towards and, more importantly, what do you avoid? Chances are you don’t spend time seeking out and interacting with content that offers you no real value.</p>
<p>If social content doesn’t serve a convincing purpose, whether that’s entertaining, informing or the like, it’s unlikely you’ll make the conscious decision to invest more time in consuming it. This is, of course, something that’s great to keep in mind when you’re creating and sharing your own content on your B2B company’s social media.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">B2B social media marketing</a>, understanding your customers and their distinct preferences is crucial. However, once you’ve done the groundwork and, because of this, understand the different types of content that will likely perform well, it doesn’t stop there. Your execution of marketing ideas is just as important as even if you’ve got brilliant ideas in the works, they can still fail to land when implemented poorly.</p>
<p>Engaging content is dynamic – don’t underestimate the importance of variety.</p>
<p>You want to stand out (in a good way), which can be hard in a flooded market of B2B businesses, all of which are competing for the attention of their target audience. Your B2B social media content is pivotal in setting your company apart from the rest and, ultimately, gives users a reason to maintain interest in your page.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When most people think about <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">social media marketing</a>, they think about B2C companies selling their products to large groups of consumers. The channel has expanded significantly in the last decade and has become an effective way of influencing purchase behaviours.</p>
<p>Social networks are the biggest source of inspiration for consumer purchases with 37% of consumers finding purchase inspiration through the channel.</p>
<p>However, any marketer that thinks this stat is only referring to B2C consumers is wrong.</p>
<p>Social media reaches B2B decision-makers, <a href="https://www.idg.com/blog/5-statistics-will-change-view-b2b-buyers-journey/">with 84% of C-level and VP-level buyers being influenced by social media</a> when purchasing. Other high-level decision makers use social media as a resource to research B2B opportunities by looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof">social proof</a> before making their purchases.</p>
<p>Despite the growing trend in B2B buyers using social media platforms, many marketers are lagging behind the trend in adopting <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">B2B social media marketing</a> as an integral part of their strategy.</p>
<p>If you’re one of them, you are missing significant opportunities to build your brand and generate leads.</p>
<h2>B2B Social Media Marketing Doesn’t Have to Be Boring</h2>
<p>Most B2B marketers that shy away from social media say that the reason for doing so is that they are in a ‘boring’ industry and would have nothing interesting to post about. What they are forgetting, is that with over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/">2.77 billion social media users around the globe</a>, there is bound to be a number of users with an interest in their industry. You just have to find them.</p>
<p>The key to engaging these people is to identify the type of content around your products or industry that your audience is likely to be interested in, rather than being self-promotional. For example, financial services such as insurance can seem very dry and uninteresting, so sharing information about business insurance isn’t likely to get your audience’s attention and drive engagement. Rather than being so focused on the products or services that you provide, think about the audience you are trying to reach. People buying business insurance are likely to be business owners and as such, may be interested in articles about protecting and growing their business. This gives you more scope as to what you can post and focuses your social strategy on your audience rather than your business.</p>
<h2>The Basics of B2B Social Media Marketing</h2>
<p>Planning and executing a <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">B2B social media marketing</a> strategy that gets results is about generating engagement through interesting content. The following can help you do just that.</p>
<h3>Give Your Brand Some Personality</h3>
<p>Don’t treat social media as an afterthought, as your posts are likely to lack personality if you do this. You don’t have to be ‘out there’ or controversial to have personality on social media, but developing a consistent social media voice is a great way to ensure you are holding the attention of your audience. Be conversational and ensure you are engaging with your audience rather than just sharing your own message. In addition, if you can get it over the line in your company, try <a href="/why-humour-is-an-effective-marketing-tool/">adding a bit of humour to your posts</a>. Social media is a place for users to relax and unwind, so this type of content fits in well. Just make sure you stay on-brand.</p>
<h3>Focus on More than LinkedIn</h3>
<p>LinkedIn is known to be the most effective B2B social media platform. That’s why more than 90% of B2B companies prefer LinkedIn for their product marketing. While LinkedIn is undoubtedly a powerful platform for B2B marketers and is by far the most likely to generate leads, other social media platforms can be more effective in brand building.</p>
<p>When using other channels, bear in mind that most people spend time on social media to entertain themselves and kill time. If you can fit in, or add to this experience, you will significantly raise brand awareness. In order to do this effectively, first work out where your audience is spending most of their time.</p>
<p>B2B companies are starting to take note of this and expand beyond LinkedIn. A recent report from <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-industry-report-2015/">Social Media Examiner</a> found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>89% of B2B marketers use LinkedIn</li>
<li>88% use Facebook</li>
<li>83% use Twitter</li>
<li>61% use Google+</li>
<li>55% use YouTube</li>
<li>39% use Pinterest</li>
<li>26% use Instagram</li>
</ul>
<p>The companies that are on Instagram, YouTube and other platforms that aren’t commonly associated with B2B marketing are harnessing the power of social media in building their brand and online community. In order to work out what channels your audience is most active on, check out these <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-demographics/">social media demographics</a>.</p>
<h3>Have a Dedicated Social Manager</h3>
<p>It is vital to have someone responsible for developing and executing a social media strategy. This can be through hiring a social media manager or appointing someone within your team to take charge of the channels as part of their role.</p>
<p>When you are looking for someone to take on this role, ensure they have a bit of background knowledge in social media, rather than an industry expert. Industry experts can help inform relevant content, but the social media expert will frame it in a way that resonates with the audience.</p>
<h2>How to Accelerate Your B2B Social Media Marketing Strategy</h2>
<p>Once you have decided what channels to be on and you are posting regular content, there are certain things you can do to make your social channels work to their full potential for your business.</p>
<h3>Encourage Employee Advocacy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/topic/algorithm-updates/">Social media algorithms</a> are constantly changing and it’s becoming more and more difficult for businesses to expand their social reach organically. Taking advantage of the connections of your employees is one way to overcome this. This is as simple as encouraging your employees to share company blogs, infographics and videos, and making it easy for them to do so.</p>
<p>Employee advocacy is all about giving your employees the ability to champion your brand to their own circles. For instance, if your company creates content, make it easy for employees to share it on their personal profiles. As well as increasing reach, if your employees share your content your <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/socialmedia/employee-advocacy-marketing-engine-of-the-future">engagement rates are also likely to increase</a>.</p>
<h3>Harness The Power of Social Selling</h3>
<p>The buying process has significantly changed as a result of social media, and B2B companies have to take note. Buyers are reading online reviews, searching for solutions to problems on search engine and using social media to vet new companies. <u>55% of B2B buyers</u> search for information on social media, so often by the time a prospect speaks to your company, they are already aware of your products or services.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/socialmedia/employee-advocacy-marketing-engine-of-the-future">Social selling</a> is, as its name suggests, using social media to introduce prospects into your funnel. Basically, it is the process of using <a href="/11-social-hacks-to-improve-your-b2b-networking-skills/">social media</a> to find people who could benefit from your product or service. You can then build a relationship with them on social media by providing them with valuable content. Very few brands are currently doing social selling, so if your business can get it right, you’re likely to see significant results.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember is that social selling is much more powerful when it comes from an individual profile rather than the business’s page or profile.</p>
<h3>Consider User Generated-Content</h3>
<p>B2B businesses don’t necessarily think of user-generated content as an option for them. However, when implemented correctly, it can be extremely effective. This is because your prospects are far more likely to be convinced by endorsements from their peers than traditional marketing. In fact, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-do-you-trust-92-consumers-peer-recommendations-over-joey-little">92% of consumers trust peer recommendations above all other forms of advertising.</a></p>
<p>A great way to build user-generated content for B2B is to create a user-generated FAQs page on your website, where users can ask and answer questions about your business. Testimonials, in particular, video testimonials, can also be a great form of user-generated content.</p>
<h3>Monitor Your Competitors</h3>
<p>By tracking your competitors’ activity on different social platforms, you can find out quickly and easily what works and what doesn’t in your industry. This can help inform your own social media marketing strategies. There are a number of <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/top-social-media-monitoring-tools/">social media monitoring tools</a> available that can help your business track competitor accounts to discover posts that get high engagement, the ideal post length, good hashtags to use and the best time to share, as well as influential users who interact with your competitors. This data can help identify how to best engage your audience.</p>
<h3>Optimise Your Calls-to-Action</h3>
<p>Whether for paid or organic posts, optimising your social media calls-to-action (CTAs) is the best way to get more clicks. Social media analyst Dan Zarrella looked at over 200,000 tweets and found that CTAs starting with adverbs and verbs get more clicks than tweets with nouns or adjectives. By making these simple changes to the way that you write your social media content, you can significantly boost the interaction rates on your account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="lead">Social media marketing, the 3 words which have completely changed the landscape of B2C marketing forever, but where does this leave us B2B marketers and is it worthwhile including a social media campaign into the marketing mix?</p>
<p>Social media marketing budgets almost doubled, worldwide, between 2014 and 2016 (increasing from $16 Billion USD to $31 Billion USD 2014-2016 – <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-advertising-stats/">Hootsuite 2016</a>), it is past the time where businesses are able to ignore their social marketing strategy and spend, and most certainly need to start paying very close attention to the leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Now, despite the massive increase in social media marketing interest and spend, 85% of B2B marketers haven’t been able to show a quantitative impact on their business as a direct result of social media spend (<a href="http://deloitte.wsj.com/cmo/2017/01/24/who-has-the-biggest-marketing-budgets/">The CMO Survey 2016</a>). This is a clear indicator of businesses treating social media the same as they have treated traditional media sources for so long,  that is, throwing a massive wad of cash at an ideas board and hoping something sticks.</p>
<p>A large percentage of companies are assuming that, by spending more money and blasting ads in front of as many people as possible, they will get greater returns on their marketing spend, but as shown in the results from the CMO survey, this could not be further from the truth.</p>
<p><a href="/11-social-hacks-to-improve-your-b2b-networking-skills/">Social media marketing</a> is all about getting a great ROI, and having the ability to turn a small spend into a massive return. To do this, companies need to be more creative with their campaigns, and put themselves in front of their customers where and when the customer is actually engaged and caring.</p>
<h4>Strategy &#8211; Influencer Marketing</h4>
<p><em>Influencer Marketing is centred around the theory that there is a much greater chance that a person will buy something when it has been recommended by someone they trust.</em></p>
<p>More than 90% of all consumers trust earned media, I.e. word of mouth, more than any other types of marketing collateral (Nielson Report 2017). However, the next closest avenue for marketers is to employ thought leaders and industry influencers. For example, if you are selling the world&#8217;s best processor, a customer is far more likely to trust the word, or endorsement, of a 3<sup>rd</sup> party expert in the field, say Bill Gates, as opposed to an advertisement from your business saying the exact same thing. This is as true for B2B marketers as it is for B2C marketers.</p>
<h4>Best Practice</h4>
<p>One B2B company that has been able to make the most from influencer marketing is American Express. AMEX collaborated with Grace Bonney and her team at Design*Sponge, as well as cable’s HGTV host  Emily Henderson to design engaging Amex branded decals. These decals were designed to resonate with small merchants, and encourage and incentivise those businesses to display the decals in their business, and then share the results on social media.</p>
<p>This campaign generated over 5 million impressions, but most importantly, earned over 50,000 social engagements from small business owners (<a href="http://shortyawards.com/8th/love-my-store-campaign">Shorty Awards 2015</a>). These 50,000 engagements all acted as a type of influencer marketing for other business owners who were not currently offering Amex in their establishments. As a result Amex saw a huge increase in interest in their product from small businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding Social Media and the complex algorithms behind the programs is vital for marketers and business owners who want to succeed online. Facebook is the go-to for B2B businesses, with <a href="https://hootsuite.com/resources/guide/barometer-2018-global">89% of B2B companies</a> using the channel to generate leads. However, as Facebook’s <a href="https://www.falcon.io/insights-hub/industry-updates/social-media-updates/facebook-algorithm-change/#GEN">algorithm changes</a> continue to limit the organic reach of posts, it’s important for brands to look for other channels to promote their products and services.</p>
<p>Smart digital marketers are already using LinkedIn – if you’re not one of them, consider the following stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <a href="https://foundationinc.co/lab/b2b-marketing-linkedin-stats/">9 billion content impressions </a>in the LinkedIn feed every week</li>
<li>LinkedIn makes up <a href="https://sumo.com/stories/linkedin-traffic">more than 50% of all social traffic to B2B websites</a> &amp; blogs</li>

</ul>
<p>The platform built for business networking, LinkedIn is ideal for <a href="/">B2B marketers</a> looking to generate leads, promote thought leadership content and drive traffic to their company website.</p>
<p>LinkedIn recently announced a <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/looking-for-an-alternative-to-facebook-consider-linkedin/516889/">60% increase in engagement rates</a> and the platform has been continuously adding to the functionality of its already powerful marketing and ad offerings. From <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-nemo/why-linkedin-is-about-to-become-scary-good.html">focusing on search filtering</a> and leveraging user data, to introducing video ad format and other <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/linkedin-announces-new-trending-stories-feed-boost-content-engagement">content options</a>, LinkedIn has huge potential for B2B marketers to reach out to prospects.</p>

<p>The same goes for any marketing campaign. Before you start, you have to define your goals and objectives. Common LinkedIn marketing goals involve <a href="/lead-generation-4/">generating leads</a>, raising brand awareness, or both. Again, as with any campaign, it’s important to be specific with your goals. Don’t just say ‘lead generation’ but rather ‘generate 25 leads from financial services business owners on LinkedIn within 3 months.’ This makes it easier to measure how successful your campaign has been in reaching your marketing objectives.</p>
<p>In addition, once you know what you want to achieve, it’s easier to define your audience. Taking the above example, if you’re looking for financial services business owners, consider how big you want the company to be, any niche industries you want them to operate in and any other relevant considerations for your business. You can then tailor your LinkedIn campaign to suit this audience and reach your goals.</p>
<h3>Make Sure Your own Profile is Optimised</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, people do business with people, so even if your end goal is to grow your business page, it’s important to start with your own LinkedIn profile. Your LinkedIn profile and the profiles of everyone else at the company are linked to your company’s LinkedIn account, so they all form part of your business brand. In addition your profile is likely one of the first things a prospect will see about your brand, so you want to make sure it makes a good impression on them. When they look at your profile, they’ll ask themselves, “Can I see myself working with this person?” You want to make sure that they can.</p>
<p>LinkedIn offers a number of ways to optimise your profile to ensure it generates profile views. It prompts users to fill out their profile to 100% completeness, so that’s a good place to start. Make sure you fill out all the sections and then optimise your profile over time, constantly adding new skills, achievements, and examples of your work to position yourself as an expert in your field.  <a href="https://www.learnhowtobecome.org/career-resource-center/how-to-create-linkedin-profile/">This article gives a full overview of the things you should be doing to create an outstanding LinkedIn profile page</a>.</p>
<h3>Create Your LinkedIn Company Page</h3>
<p>Your LinkedIn company page is basically your business’ LinkedIn profile. In order to fully optimise your page, it’s important to give prospective customers the opportunity to learn more about your company, what it does, and the team who work there.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/company-pages/get-started">Companies with complete information get 30% more weekly views</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>You don’t need much information to complete your LinkedIn profile, just the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> A description of your company’s products or services using relevant keywords and phrases that describe your business, expertise and industry focus. These keywords and phrases are extremely important to include as they are as searchable by LinkedIn users.</li>
<li><strong>Logo:</strong> LinkedIn gives your business the opportunity to add a company logo and a cover image to ensure your page is on-brand.</li>
<li><strong>Company Information:</strong> LinkedIn asks for your website URL, location, industry and company size as this is relevant information that is of interest to searchers looking at your business page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ensure Your Company Page is Optimised for Search</h3>
<p>In order to grow your audience on LinkedIn, your page has to be found. As such, it is vital to optimise your company page for search. LinkedIn company pages are designed to be SEO friendly, for searchers both on and off the platform. The following are some of the things you can do to ensure your page is optimised:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Keywords and Phrases: </strong>Make sure you incorporate your business’ keywords into the company profile information. The keywords you choose should clearly represent who you are and what you do and match the words that a potential client would use when searching for your products or services.</li>
<li><strong>Get Backlink to your Company Page: </strong>Just like regular SEO, <a href="https://www.webconfs.com/importance-of-backlinks-article-5.php">creating backlinks</a> to your LinkedIn company page is essential for boosting your search ranking. The easiest way to do this is to link to your LinkedIn profile from your business website, blog and any other online marketing materials. In addition, ensure your business’ employees have their LinkedIn profile linked back to the Company Page.</li>
<li><strong>Share Relevant Content: </strong>Again, like regular SEO, sharing regular content can help improve your rankings. When you publish updates from your Company Page they also appear on your public page, which means that Google can index your content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Share Engaging Content on Your Company Page</h3>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/linkedin-pages/best-practices">Companies that post weekly see a 2x lift in engagement with their content</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The more frequently you share content that your followers engage with, the higher your company page will appear in search results. In order to generate engagement, you have to share things that your target audience finds interesting. By monitoring the clicks, shares, and comments on each of your posts, you can see the type of content that your audience is most engaged with. One tip to remember is that content that comes across as “salesy” doesn’t generally perform well on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Instead, sharing content that can help your audience in their roles, answer their questions, or help them overcome pain points typically works well. As well as posting your own content, it can be useful to share insightful content from other organisations and associations with your followers to provide them with more value.</p>
<p>When curating your content to post on LinkedIn, remember that the human brain processes images exponentially faster than text. As such, posts with images generate over <a href="http://www.inc.com/larry-kim/visual-content-marketing-16-eye-popping-statistics-you-need-to-know.html">six times more engagement </a>than content that only has text. By posting relevant, interesting and insightful content regularly you can also position your business as a <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/9253-thought-leadership.html">thought leader</a> in your industry.</p>
<h3>Pay for LinkedIn Advertising<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Reaching followers organically on LinkedIn is not as difficult as Facebook, with its complex algorithms that mean <a href="https://www.kunocreative.com/blog/facebook-reach-in-2018">less than 2% of followers actually see the company’s posts</a>. While it may be easier to reach your customers on LinkedIn rather than on Facebook, growing your business completely organically can take a long time. Advertising can help you reach your goals quicker.</p>
<p>LinkedIn used to be extremely limited with their advertising options. However, this has changed a lot recently with the platform developing more diverse options for advertisers and giving them more freedom in their methods for reaching their goals on the platform. The most commonly used objectives for LinkedIn advertising are lead generation, job applications, video views and website visits. However, advertisers also use the platform for brand awareness, engagement and website conversions.</p>
<p>When you sponsor your content on LinkedIn, you can choose the exact audience that you want to show your message to based on their professional credentials through LinkedIn’s comprehensive targeting options.</p>
<p>The following are some of the most commonly used ad types that LinkedIn currently offers advertisers:</p>
<h4>Sponsored Content</h4>
<p><u>LinkedIn Sponsored Posts</u> can be used to promote your content in the LinkedIn feeds of the professionals you want to target. It is most effective if you use a content update that has received good engagement rates from your audience, as this is a good indication that it’s relevant for the people that you want to target. By placing your message in front of the right people, you’re not only more likely to get higher engagement on that post, but you may also attract followers by introducing your company to more people.</p>
<h4>Sponsored InMail<strong><br />
</strong></h4>
<p>This is an advertising option where you can pay LinkedIn to send messages straight to people’s LinkedIn inbox. When done properly, this method of advertising can convert higher than any of the other LinkedIn ad options. As these ads come from a personal profile rather than a branded business page, people don&#8217;t feel like they are being sold to and are more likely to be receptive to the message. They key to success is to ensure each InMail is personalised.</p>
<h4>Video Ads<strong><br />
</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p><a href="54%25%20of%20consumers%20want%20to%20see%20more%20video%20content%20from%20a%20brand%20or%20business%20they%20support.">54% of consumers want to see more video content from a brand or business they support.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>LinkedIn’s video ads simply help businesses promote their videos to their target market. In order to be most effective, it’s important to test a variety of videos to see which type of video, topic, length, and style is best for your business’ conversions and engagement.</p>
<p>A killer LinkedIn Marketing strategy will incorporate both organic and paid content to really get your brand message out to your target audience.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Understanding B2B social media can be challenging. Research brands that are flourishing on social media and the chances are the first ten companies you stumble across are B2C companies. You&#8217;ll rarely hear about an HR consultancy going viral on Instagram or a rubber manufacturer crushing it on Facebook.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that B2B companies cannot be successful on <a href="/3-keys-to-unlocking-your-b2b-social-media-potential/">social media</a> &#8211; flourishing social media pages for B2B exist. The only thing is, they are a minority&#8230;. but that&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>That means there is a gap in the industry for B2B representation on social media. It also means that the B2B social media market is NOT saturated therefore, your business has less competitors online.</p>
<p>The following contains 5 social media strategies and best practices that will aid your B2B business online:</p>
<h3>1. Get on Social Media</h3>
<p>Seems straightforward enough but so many B2B companies are still shying away from using social media. &#8220;But I work in a boring industry&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; that my friend, is where you&#8217;re wrong. An example of an industry that may be considered &#8216;boring&#8217; but is doing great on social media is Xerox. They sell document solutions and technologies but have over 9 million views across their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/XeroxCorp?&amp;ab_channel=Xerox">Youtube Channel</a>. Their videos on digital printing and document solutions were a hit!</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t shy away from using social media. Use this tool to grow your business and connect with the public and potential clients.</p>

<h3>2. Two birds with One Stone: Consistency &amp; Involvement</h3>
<p>Consistency is key! But who&#8217;s got the time? It can be overwhelming to come up with new, consistent and quality content every day or every week so it&#8217;s best to get the team involved! Give your employees the opportunity to have their voices heard and their work stories shared. Your employees can do this in various ways such as sharing how they got into their field, what they do in the company and why it is important or providing tips and strategies or best practices for their line of work.</p>
<p>Getting your employees involved in creating content online can also benefit company relationships as your employees will feel more valued and heard. They will also be more likely to share the company&#8217;s social media sites as they may want to show their family and friends that they were featured</p>
<p>Remember: customers always prefer a personal approach so, involving your employees in this creative process will humanize your business as your social media audience will get a glimpse of the people behind the company.</p>
<h3>3. Get Engaged!</h3>
<p>Speaking of personal approach,  it is also important to engage with your customers or potential customers on social media. Making that human connection is key in creating and maintaining relationships with clients. Social media allows B2B companies to create these connections efficiently but without cutting corners.</p>
<p>Support your clients by engaging in their content! As a B2B company, they may also struggle with the challenges of social media therefore, they will appreciate your engagement in their content. Follow them on social media and like, share and comment on their posts, articles and pictures.</p>
<p>When other companies or individuals engage with your posts on social media, be sure to like or reply in effort to show appreciation and demonstrate your company&#8217;s customer service quality.</p>
<h3>4. Develop a Presence</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, a lot of B2B companies online treat social media as an afterthought and therefore publish content that are lacking in personality. You don&#8217;t need to be a twitter troll or be overly obnoxious or edgy to be entertaining online. You do however, need to sound like an actual human rather than an automated robot online &#8212; people want to connect with people!</p>
<p>You can do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using conversational tone and language ~hold off on the jargon and engage in language that most people will understand. Not everyone will know about the &#8216;Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory&#8217; that your client may be trying to market however, more people might understand it if you describe it as a &#8216;personality test&#8217;, a &#8216;psychology test&#8217; or even a &#8216;psychometric test&#8217;.</li>
<li>Make Conversation ~ Social media isn&#8217;t just about broadcasting your message&#8230; it&#8217;s about connecting! So connect with your audience. Don&#8217;t be afraid to start a conversation with them (whether they are happy or angry). In 2013,<a href="http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2013-social-media-benchmark-study"> 67%</a> of consumers used company social media sites for service updates and inquiries while <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2012/state-of-the-media-the-social-media-report-2012.html">33%</a> of people prefer to contact businesses on <a href="/3-keys-to-unlocking-your-b2b-social-media-potential/">social media</a> relative to the telephone. Thus, interaction is still better than neglect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Expand Outside of LinkedIn</h3>
<p>While LinkedIn has been ranked as the most effective platform for B2B businesses, you don&#8217;t need to limit your business to one platform. Generating leads should not be your only focus as branding and brand loyalty are also important. Other B2B marketers have realized this and are <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-marketing-industry-report-2015/">expanding outside of LinkedIn</a></p>

<li>89% use LinkedIn</li>
<li>88% use Facebook</li>
<li>83% use Twitter</li>
<li>61% use Google+</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your B2B business struggling to gain engagement on the major social media networks? A lot has been written about the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2014/08/11/the-top-10-benefits-of-social-media-marketing/#21cff9891f80">importance of using Social Media</a> to help grow your business,<a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/b2bsocialmediamarketing/"> particularly in the B2B sector</a>.</p>
<p>While major social media sites allow people from all over the world to discuss and share anything that comes to mind, niche ones have the advantage that they focus on a specific topic or industry. Subsequently, the people connecting on these social media sites are much more interested in those specific topics. There are a number of niche social media platforms that, if implemented into your overall digital marketing strategy, could act as excellent communication and promotional channels for your company.</p>
<p>For small business marketing, niche <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">social media</a> sites provide an interesting opportunity to connect with a highly targeted audience. This is particularly effective for marketers, because the more targeted your audience is, the higher your conversion rates are likely to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Benefits Of Niche Social Platforms</h2>
<p>Niche social networking sites are social networks geared toward a very specific target audience, creating an online network of individuals who bond over a specialised <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/feature/353300/10-niche-social-networks-to-use-instead-of-facebook">common interest.</a></p>
<p>It’s important to remember that because they are so specific, the traffic and audience is smaller on niche social media sites. However, the increased relevance of the content and topics means that the return on investment can often be higher.</p>
<p>This is the main benefit of being active on a niche social media site that aligns with your company’s product or service. It is easier to engage and convert individuals that already have an interest in something that your brand offers, rather than trying to promote the benefits of your business credit checking service on Facebook, where users are more interested in memes and funny videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How To Find The Right Network For Your Business</h2>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2Badvertisingagency.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4479" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2Badvertisingagency-300x300.png" alt="http://maxpixel.freegreatpicture.com/photo-1414775" width="258" height="258" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2Badvertisingagency-300x300.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2Badvertisingagency-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2Badvertisingagency.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now you know the benefits of being active on a niche social media site, but which platform should you implement as part of your small business marketing strategy?</p>
<p>Finding the right niche platform is crucial to your success. The first step to finding the right network for your business is to <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/choosing-a-social-media-niche">understand your audience.</a> With any social media site, you want to locate your audience and tailor your communication to fit their needs, which is why niche platform activity only works if the people you want to reach are actually active on it. Do your research and ensure your target audience are present. A simple Google Search can get you far. Is your business is the beer brewing industry? Simply type in: social media networks for beer lovers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Four Niche Social Media Sites To Consider</h2>
<p>Major social networks such as Twitter and Facebook have become increasingly overcrowded, making it much harder to stand out and gain results. Niche social media networking is all about <a href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/niche-social-networks/">going deep, not wide.</a></p>
<p>To provide you with a taste of what kinds of niche social media networks are out there, here are four niche social media networks that exist, each representing a different demographic or industry:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1: Untappd</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Untappd.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4483 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Untappd-300x194.jpg" alt="Untappd - niche social media" width="300" height="194" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Untappd-300x194.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Untappd.jpg 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2: ActiveRain</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ravelry is a free social networking service for anyone who works with yarn and patterns, including knitting, crocheting, weaving and spinning. It is an online community where users can inspire, share, learn and discover new trends within the yarn artisan community.</p>
<p>Ravelry allow crafters to advertise and sell their knitting, patterns or yarn on the site, to help promote your own business targeted to yarn artists. Members are often hobbyists, or professionals promoting their business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

However, about 75% of B2B marketers use Facebook and Twitter to distribute content. About 60 % use YouTube as a channel for B2B marketing, and 35 % use Google+.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.socialmedianews.com.au/social-media-statistics-australia-january-2017/">Social media statistics from Australia in 2017</a> shows that Facebook has 16,000,000 monthly users, YouTube has about 14,800,000 monthly users, Twitter has approximately 2,800,000 monthly users and Google Plus has approximately 60.000 monthly users. With this in mind, there is really no question as to social media´s usefulness for B2B businesses.</p>
<p>Potential B2B buyers are more likely to consider brands that consumer know and feel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/b2b-sales-strategy-evoke-emotions-bob-leonard/">connected to.</a> Below are a few social media strategies and practices you should consider adding to your marketing efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1: Use social media for content promotion</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Socialmedia.jgp_-e1519344534181.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4468 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Socialmedia.jgp_-e1519344534181-300x280.jpg" alt="social " width="300" height="280" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Socialmedia.jgp_-e1519344534181-300x280.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Socialmedia.jgp_-e1519344534181.jpg 626w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Social media creates new, low-cost avenues for content promotion. A <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2017_Australia_Research_FINAL.pdf">content marketing study</a> in Australia revealed that 42 % of Australian marketers said that social media content would be critical to their content marketing success in 2017. However, remember that customers are not on your social media page to hear your sales pitch. With social media, the main focus should be on crafting relevant and interesting content creating audience engagement. Whether it comes from photos, videos or copy, it helps showcase your products or services and tell your company´s story in a more fun, straight forward and meaningful way. This will in turn help towards personalising your brand and to build stronger customer relationships.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing reasons to use social media marketing is to attract new leads that might eventually turn into paying customers. Direct leads are generated by sharing content on social media that links directly back to a form on a landing page on your website where visitors can share information in exchange for an offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2: Humanise your brand</h3>
<p class="normal"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/connectcustomers-e1519343968957.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4465 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/connectcustomers-e1519343968957-300x261.jpg" alt="The Lead Agency" width="300" height="261" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/connectcustomers-e1519343968957-300x261.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/connectcustomers-e1519343968957-768x668.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/connectcustomers-e1519343968957-1024x891.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/connectcustomers-e1519343968957.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p class="normal">B2B businesses connecting with their consumers on an emotional level earn twice the impact over B2B marketers who are still trying to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140529151833-298076-calling-all-b2b-marketers-the-real-value-of-connecting-with-consumers/"><span style="color: blue;">sell business.</span></a></p>
<p class="normal">As a B2B business you have to appear professional and as an expert within your field. However, it is important to keep in mind that in the end of the day, people relate to you on a human level, which is a great reminder that personalising your content, cannot only be useful, but relatable. By being more personal you can also collect more attribute data about your potential buyers.</p>
<p class="normal">Humour is a great way to humanise your brand. Brands that use humour are more relatable, and therefore, more approachable in the eyes of the customer, which makes them seem more <a href="/why-humour-is-an-effective-marketing-tool/"><span style="color: blue;">“human”.</span></a></p>
<p class="normal">Another way to personalise your business online is to post employee quotes and updates. This will demonstrate the value you place on employers, improving internal and external perception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3: Online customer service</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2BmarketingAgency.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4466 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2BmarketingAgency-300x212.jpg" alt="B2B social media" width="300" height="212" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2BmarketingAgency-300x212.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2BmarketingAgency-768x542.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B2BmarketingAgency.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>The big benefit of social media is being able to talk directly to customers and engage with them in a timely and appropriate way. You want to create an online presence by building and nurturing two-way communication relationships with your customers based on trust and respect.</p>
<p>It is important to follow up on complaints and give customer information that they ask for. This is especially important to consider as <a href="http://www.jdpower.com/press-releases/2013-social-media-benchmark-study">67% of consumers</a> have used a company’s social media site for service updates and customer service inquires.</p>
<p>Customers are increasingly using social media to ask service questions and to raise issues, making it equally important to have a strong online customer service strategy in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Key factors to consider</h2>
<p>Using social media for content promotion, generating leads, performing outstanding online customer service and infusing personality into your brand is all part of effective B2B business social media strategies and practices.</p>
<p>There are plenty of strategies and practices to choose from. What is important is tailoring your strategies according to your business goals and being where your target audience are.</p>
<p>A successful social media strategy holds strong social media presence; strengthening brand awareness and building customer relationships, with the ultimate goal of generating leads and conversions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, social media platforms provide new and exciting ways to foster customer relationships. Create audience engagement by posting relevant and interesting content. Improve internal and external perception by personalising and humanising your brand. Perform excellent customer service by creating and nurturing two-way communication relationships with your customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve read all the articles and you’ve listened to all the experts. You know that social media marketing is a key component of the B2B sales process – then how come you aren’t seeing the results you were hoping for?</p>
<p>Well, all those social media advocates weren’t wrong &#8211; social media marketing (SMM) is a key marketing and lead-nurturing tool. Just look at the statistics below.</p>
<ol>
<li>83% of B2B marketers use social media; making it the most common B2B marketing tactic (<a href="http://www.targetmarketingmag.com/post/death-salesman/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BVm7MI5EoSVmvkR%2BS8QvFvA%3D%3D">Source</a>)</li>
<li>More than 70% of all B2B marketers use at least one of the “Big 4” social media sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube) to distribute content (<a href="http://b2bprblog.marxcommunications.com/b2bpr/top-b2b-pr-mistakes-to-avoid?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BVm7MI5EoSVmvkR%2BS8QvFvA%3D%3D">Source</a>)</li>
<li>54% of B2B marketers said they’ve generated leads from social media (<a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20150624T211502__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Industries_15/Accenture-B2B-Procurement-Study.pdf">Source</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>So what is your B2B company doing wrong? You’ve followed the guidelines, you’re on all the most popular platforms, and you are regularly sharing content; yet you still can’t gain any traction. Find out below some of the most common reasons why B2B companies fail at social media marketing.</p>
<h2>Five Reasons Why Social Media Marketing May Not Be For You</h2>
<p>Social media is only a little over a decade old. As a result, its ‘shiny and new’ status has captured the imaginations of millions of entrepreneurs and marketers around the world – spouting endless articles and discussions online, in universities, at business events, and in boardrooms.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is blasphemous to say social media doesn’t work for your business. You could be labeled a ‘luddite’ or your views as ‘antiquated’. But, in reality, social media doesn’t work for 100% of businesses 100% of the time.</p>
<p>There are five questions you need to consider before investing heavily in social media.</p>
<h3>1.     Does Your Target Audience Use Social Media?</h3>
<p><a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">Social media</a> may not be as ubiquitous as you think. Only 24% of small businesses in 2017 found social media important in acquiring new customers; whilst over 51% said they saw little to no benefit to their bottom line according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/321704/us-small-business-social-media-usage/">Statistica</a>.</p>
<p>The B2B buyer journey is a complex one, requiring different messaging to each of the different stakeholders that play a role in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Although social media might engage a younger millennial workforce; it may do little to engage an older upper management demographic who have grown up without it.</p>
<p>Social media is limited by who is on it. In B2B SMM, you are relying on the social media users in a company to filter the information up to the decision makers.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4419 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="Target Audience using Social Media" width="864" height="544" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png 864w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1-300x189.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1-768x484.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /></p>
<h3>2.     Will Your Messaging Work On Social Media?</h3>
<p>Social media is transient – very little of your company messaging will stick with customers. You only have to look at YouTube, with its five-second ad windows, to see how difficult it is to get your message across.</p>
<p>Social media relies on a constant stream of content. Many marketers will advocate that you have up to six seconds to win over your prospect with your message – this isn’t much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/278922">Recent Nueromarketing research</a> indicates your impulsive ‘reptilian brain’ takes precedence over your rational decision-making neocortex processes; even in B2B purchases. As a result, you may have less than a second to make a real impression on a viewer.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of B2B products and services and their delivery, it is hard to convey those types of messages using a channel like social media.</p>
<h3>3.     Do You Have A Solid Online Sales Funnel?</h3>
<p>Social media is a great way to drive engagement and awareness of your product; however, engagement and awareness aren’t good enough if they don’t lead to sales.</p>
<p>Having a well developed website, with clear and enticing calls to action, should be your first consideration.</p>
<p>Consider your online sales funnel like a body of freshwater thawing its way down a mountain into a freshwater lake. Your social media is the snowy peak; it is very early on in the process. Your funnel is the series of glaciers, rivers and wetlands that lead to your figurative ‘lake of sales’. The better you establish your funnel the more of that snow is going to find it’s way to you.</p>
<p>Understanding the sales funnel can be complex. There are many ways to measure and evaluate your marketing activities. In the past, many marketers traditionally attributed the success of a campaign to whatever activity led to a sale – this was known as ‘single-source attribution’. However, with the advent of analytics and advanced measurement tools, the value of the marketing mix as a whole has gained a lot of traction.</p>
<p>In team sports, such as basketball, the players that are assisting are just as valuable as those making the shots. The same is true of modern marketing. Today, marketers attribute success to many channels and activities – this form of marketing is known as ‘multi-touch attribution’.</p>

<h3>4.     Do You The Have Time and Resources For Social Media?</h3>
<p>Depending on the size of your business you might find that managing several social media accounts can be time-consuming, especially if you are one of many people who see social media as a chore and not a pleasure.</p>
<p>Having some form of social media is important. Even if you aren’t constantly updating it, setting up a Facebook and/or LinkedIn account with as much information as possible can be highly valuable to your potential customers.</p>
<p>Depending on your industry, finding content can be difficult. Don’t use up all your best stuff straight away; be sure to spread it out.</p>
<p>Minimise your commitment till you have the time to work on it or the resources to have someone assist you with it.</p>
<h3>5.     Is There A Better Way To Spend Your Marketing Dollars?</h3>
<p>Social media and other online channels can seem like easy ways to spend your marketing dollars. At the click of a button you can get your message out to thousands or even millions of people.</p>
<p>However, depending on your product, brand and target audience, spending that money on an ad in your local newspaper could bring in a much greater ROI.</p>
<h2>Eight Insights to Better Your Social Media Marketing Efforts</h2>
<p>So, you are convinced social platforms is the right channel for your business; yet, your posts go unliked, your followers will not engage with you and you’ve sunk a lot of money on sponsored content with little return.</p>
<p>Below are six lessons to guide you in your B2B social efforts. Find out what you are doing wrong, and how you can make SMM more meaningful and beneficial to you.</p>
<h3>1.     Perspective Is Key</h3>
<p>Before you can begin marketing your business properly on social media, you might need to re-evaluate your expectations. What outcomes do you want from your social activities?</p>
<p>Let’s be clear that social media is a fickle thing. You might prepare a campaign and you might do everything right, but there is no guarantee anyone will engage.</p>
<p>Returns from social media aren’t a straightforward matter of investing and seeing an equivalent pay off. Marketing on social platforms is more of a gamble. You have to be ‘in it to win it’ as they say.</p>
<p>You might have grown up in a world where your Twitter following had no impact on your sales; but the world is changing and social media has come out on top.</p>
<p>Think of SMM as more of a necessary expense, like insurance or start-up costs, which you need to keep your head above water in a sea of competitive businesses.</p>
<h3>2.     Have A Firm Strategy In Place</h3>
<p>As novelist and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once wrote, “A goal without a plan is a wish.”</p>
<p>Auditing your social media accounts and developing concrete goals for each is important. This planning process will also give you an idea about the type of content that your audience relates to.</p>
<p>Once you’ve established where you want to be and where you are now, you will be in a better position to discover the right tactics for your business</p>
<p>For more tips about to setting up your own strategy, try reading this article about <a href="/social-media-marketing-b2b-business/">B2B Social Media Marketing</a>.</p>
<h3>3.     Remember Your ‘ABC’ Rule &#8211; Always Be Consistent!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.b2bnn.com/2017/09/five-reasons-b2b-companies-fail-content-social-media-marketing/">According to CMI research</a>, one of the major challenges for B2B marketers is maintain consistency in their content.</p>
<p>Finding the right voice for your brand on social media, and consistently using it, will help distinguish your business amongst all the other vying businesses online.</p>
<p>As platforms like Facebook are beginning to deprioritise pushy sales content, giving your audience a genuine reason to follow you will be more and more important.</p>
<p>Deciding amongst your administrators what types of hash tags, emoticons, grammar and style to use will help make your audience feel like they are conversing with your brand on a more human level.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4671 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/social-media.jpg" alt="Social Media Channels" width="800" height="380" /></p>
<h3>4.     Find The Right Channels</h3>
<p>Just because Facebook has over two billion users doesn’t mean you should be using it as your primary social media channel. Find the right channel to suit your industry and audience.</p>
<p>If your business is involved in fashion and textile for example, sites like Instagram may serve your business much more.</p>
<p>Think outside of the box as well. You may not have heard of social media platforms like <a href="https://untappd.com/">Untappd</a> or <a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a>, but these niche social sites have small but highly engaged users.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/account/login">Ravelry</a> is a social media network for crocheters and knitters. If you really want to engage with your customers, meet them on the sites they are likely to be.</p>
<p>Niche social media platforms are becoming increasingly popular. Find out what is out there and see if you can reach your target audience on these platforms.</p>
<h3>5.     Make Your Brand Exciting</h3>
<p>You can spend several hours a week working on your business’ social media sites, but see barely any movement in followers or engagement. This can be very discouraging, you may find yourself questioning the point of it all.</p>
<p>You look to other competitors and see how popular they are and wonder how they are achieving all that success?</p>
<p>The reality could be that <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2017/07/19/social-media-doesn-t-work-your-brand-because-your-brand-boring">your brand needs a refresh</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that it’s very hard to gauge what will make your brand exciting to your target audience. After all, ‘exciting’ is a relative term. And, to be clear, we aren’t suggesting that you follow the ‘cool’ brands by loading your content with irreverent hash-tags and pointless click-bait.</p>
<p>The real way to find what works is to experiment. Be bold and try and new ideas often. For some hot tips, read this article on <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/marketing-boring-brand-social-media">Marketing ‘Boring’ Brands On Social Media.</a></p>
<h3>6.     Synergise With Your Sales Team</h3>
<p><a href="/b2b-marketing-services/sales-marketing-efficiencies/">Marketing and sales</a> don’t like to be confused for one another, but it is understandable why people tend to amalgamate these two professions. Sales and marketing feed off each other.</p>
<p>With metrics and analytics being increasingly common, using a <a href="/b2b-marketing-attribution-how-single-source-attribution-is-hurting-your-business/">mixed attribution</a> system to measure the success of your marketing campaigns will help you understand what is and isn’t working much better.</p>
<p>Coordinate your marketing efforts and share data with your sales team. Find reliable ways to monitor you customers’ buyer journeys. This will give you an idea of what social media channels are going to work for you.</p>
<p>You may find that all that marketing on YouTube has had little effect and that you could be spending your money on advertising on Instagram for better results.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hopefully, some of these tips have helped you reconsider your social strategy. Perhaps, you have been relying on social media at the expense of other channels, or maybe your content just hasn’t connected just yet.</p>
<p>Creating value for your consumers is the only real way to convert users on social media. Keep experimenting, be bold and don’t be afraid to play around with your social media sites.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media can be a powerful B2B marketing tool. By maintaining the right image online you can instil confidence in your business, discover more about your stakeholders and position yourself better in your market. So, after doing our research, we’ve decided to share with you our top six <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">B2B social media</a> strategies to benefit your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4><em> Show off your employees</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-staff.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4282" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-staff.png" alt="employees" width="280" height="241" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-staff.png 534w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-staff-300x258.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a></p>
<p>Your employees are important to you. After all, they are what keeps the cogs of your business turning. So why not share the love?</p>
<p><a href="http://keyhole.co/blog/15-b2b-social-media-strategy-tips-best-practice-examples/">Introduce your online audience</a> to your employers. This can be as simple as a few regular posts with photos featuring your employees. As an example, ask them to share a little about what they do, what they love and what inspires them when they come into work.</p>
<p>Not only does this humanise your business, but it demonstrates the value your employees have within the organisation. This one of our top B2B business social media strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h4><em> Research your Competition</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-research.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4283 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-research.png" alt="research competition" width="600" height="400" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-research.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-research-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>B2B social media isn’t just about putting your brand out there, it can be a powerful research tool as well.</p>
<p>Find your competitors online and start monitoring their social media channels. Using social media monitoring tools like <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000176053&amp;r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com.au%2F&amp;type=2">Salesforce</a> can reveal useful information to help optimise your posts.</p>
<p>Look at what types of posts yield the highest engagement – factors might include post length, hashtags, and sharing times. Take their successes and failures and use them to your advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h4><em> Find out more about your customers</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-customers.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4284 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-customers.png" alt="Find out more about customers" width="470" height="219" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-customers.png 470w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-customers-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a></p>
<p>In Marketing and Communication it’s important to know your audience. Use social media to paint a picture of your ideal customers by creating <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33491/everything-marketers-need-to-research-create-detailed-buyer-personas-template.aspx">Buyer Personas</a>.</p>
<p>You can build a Buyer Persona by simply opening up a spreadsheet and starting a sample database of social media users. By each user add their age, gender, position, industry and other relevant information.</p>
<p>In the process of researching your customers, you might also uncover some feedback that can strengthen your business. Inevitably this kind of activity can only help you understand your customers better!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h4><em> Invest in your B2B social media content</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4285 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content.jpg" alt="Invest in your B2B social media content" width="5000" height="3328" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content.jpg 5000w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content-768x511.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-content-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 5000px) 100vw, 5000px" /></a></p>
<p>Another of our key B2B social media strategies is investing in your content.</p>
<p>As social media sites like Facebook and Twitter have become more commercialised, organic posts have increasingly less reach. If you want to be heard you need to be willing to allocate money to boost your top performing posts.</p>
<p>Advertising on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram gets more sophisticated with each year. Not only can you boost posts, but you can target specific markets and locations with increasing accuracy.</p>
<p>Relate it back to the bottom line and find out how much is the right amount for your business to invest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h4><em> Optimise your Call to Actions</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-cta.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4286 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-cta.jpg" alt="Optimise your Call to Actions" width="338" height="302" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-cta.jpg 338w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-cta-300x268.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /></a></p>
<p>A strong call to action (CTA) is the key to generating higher CTRs. Social media scientist and author, Dan Zarrella, conducted research on Twitter in 2012 and discovered that adverbs and verbs make more impact than nouns or adjectives.</p>
<p>This is backed up by several content writers from the last few decades, from author Marina Calderone to educator and speaker Patti Digh.</p>
<p>In order to optimise your engagement, avoid posting weak CTAs with passive verbs. After all, it’s doubtful Nike would have gotten far with a slogan like, “Make sure it gets done.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h4><em>Join a group or start one</em></h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4287 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups.jpg" alt="Join a group or start one" width="793" height="410" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups.jpg 793w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups-300x155.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/08/b2b-groups-768x397.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/social-media-for-b2b/">Groups and communities</a> on Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn provide an excellent opportunity to reach users interested in your industry.</p>
<p>Answering questions and posting useful content on these pages is great for networking and building a reputation. You are an expert it in your field so why not share some of that knowledge – you never know what kind of friends you might make!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these tactics out for yourself and let us know what worked (and what didn’t work) for you. We love to hear from you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s no denying the success of social media marketing. That’s why 83% of marketers indicate that it’s an important part of their business’ marketing strategy [Social Media Examiner].</p>
<p>While the benefits of social media marketing practically speak for themselves, most social media marketing still comes from B2C companies, which leaves us wondering why B2B is lagging behind.</p>
<p>There are undeniable differences between the way B2B and B2C social media marketing works, but if it’s done right, it can be just as (if not more) effective in B2B.</p>
<h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">1. Content for Social Media Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>No matter whether you operate in B2B or B2C markets, the content you share on social channels should provide value to the reader. By providing your customer with value, you will position your business as a thought leader in the industry, and stay at the top of their mind when they come to make a purchasing decision.</p>
<p>The type of content and how it is delivered should however be vastly different between B2B and B2C businesses.</p>
<h4><strong>B2C Content</strong></h4>
<p>B2C businesses tend to focus heavily on blog content around sharable topics. B2C marketers also leverage the power of visual content, such as videos, infographics and eye-catching images, which are always more likely to be shared In most cases B2C messaging is also more casual, and humour is used to further engage the audience.</p>
<h4><strong>B2B Content</strong></h4>
<p>When it comes to <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-social-media-marketing/">Social Media</a> content, B2B marketers should focus on more “professional” types of content such as white papers, eBooks, case studies and webinars. While this content can be more labour-intensive to produce, it has proven to be much more effective at generating leads for B2B marketers.</p>
<p>It’s important to bear in mind that although B2B content is written in a more serious tone, on more formal topics, it should be presented in a way that is easy to digest, for example by using appropriate visuals, and breaking up long paragraphs of text with bullet points.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Social Media Channels</strong></h3>
<p>From Pinterest to Instagram, Vine and YouTube, there are social media channels for pretty much every industry niche. With such a wide variety of channels to choose from, it’s important to find the one that’s right for your business.</p>
<h4><strong>B2C Social Media Channels<br />
</strong></h4>
<p>B2C Marketers tend to favour Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for distributing their content, with Facebook being most commonly used channel in the B2C market. Facebook is the ideal platform for creating a community around the brand, which can result in sales as 77% of B2C companies claim they’ve acquired a customer through the channel [State of Inbound Marketing, 2012]. Twitter works for high visibility and regular communication, and Instagram and YouTube are effective for visual content and personalising B2C brands.</p>
<h4><strong>B2B Social Media Channels</strong></h4>
<p>B2B marketers should typically focus on three social networks: Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. LinkedIn is by far the most important social network for today’s B2B marketer as it facilitates contact with professionals and business buyers. By utilising LinkedIn, B2B marketers can increase brand awareness, establish thought leadership and generate leads. Discussion Groups are also ideal for content distribution, as long as that content doesn’t seem overly promotional. Facebook for B2B is great for brand building, while Twitter remains ideal for getting content out to the masses.</p>
<h3><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Social Media Marketing Goals</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">The final aim of the campaign is one of the main differences between B2B and B2C Social Media Marketing. B2C Social Media marketers tend to measure their success on community engagement and awareness, while B2B marketers focus more on lead generation.</span></p>
<p><strong>B2C Social Media Marketing Goals</strong></p>
<p>Social Media is a key method of attracting and engaging B2C target audiences. The main goals of B2C Social Media Marketing are to raise brand awareness and enter the consumer’s buying consideration set. In order to do this, B2C Marketers use Social Media to personalise the brand. By giving the company a human face, Social Media enables B2C businesses to interact directly with their customers to support sales and handle customer service issues.</p>
<h4><strong>B2B Social Media Marketing Goals</strong></h4>
<p>Social Media can be a powerful tool for B2B lead generation. After creating interesting content for your target audience, you can use your social media channels to promote it to people who are interested, which in turn creates potential leads. Twitter is the ideal platform for sharing content as it reaches a wide audience, while LinkedIn is a business-focused social network, so it’s usually a source of very qualified leads.</p>
