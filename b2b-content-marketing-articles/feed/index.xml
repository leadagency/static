										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Developing a competitive <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B content marketing</a> strategy and supporting <a href="/b2b-marketing-services/sales-marketing-collateral/">collateral</a> often requires an investment of time, resources and money.</p>
<p>With this in mind, it can be tempting for organisations to pass these costs onto potential or existing customers, such as through charging for access to eBooks or fact sheets. So, why is it then that so many businesses provide these valuable resources to consumers for free, when they could all too easily do otherwise?</p>
<h2>Free content &amp; the buyer journey</h2>
<p>To understand this, you first need to understand how the B2B buyer journey works. This process is long and complex, with purchases often having to be overseen and approved by a myriad of a business’ staff and/or management. There is usually a lot riding on the final decision and, ultimately, the wrong choice could cost the business greatly.</p>
<p>As such, it makes sense for those making these B2B buying decisions to be thorough when conducting research. By doing this, they can minimise any risks and gain greater confidence that their chosen product or service is in the best interests of the company.</p>
<p>All of this considered, it’s hardly surprising that <a href="https://martechtoday.com/b2b-buyers-consume-an-average-of-13-content-pieces-before-deciding-on-a-vendor-238540#:~:text=A%20mix%20of%20first%20and,required%20to%20seal%20the%20deal.&amp;text=The%20average%20B2B%20buyer's%20journey,from%20market%20research%20firm%20FocusVision.">the average B2B buyer consumes thirteen pieces of content during the purchasing journey</a>. This information provides a pretty clear indication of why so many organisations willingly give their customers and prospects free content, even though they could technically charge them.</p>
<p>An organisation’s key decision makers <em>want</em> to consume content.</p>
<p>When buyers are progressing through such a lengthy purchasing process, paying for the information and content that’s going to aid them in their decision will only act as a barrier. Instead, with useful free content, you can support key decision makers every step of the way, making the entire process easier for them.</p>
<h2>Gain a competitive edge</h2>
<p>When it comes to establishing a competitive advantage as a B2B business, <a href="https://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/custexp.htm">developing an unmatched customer experience is the most powerful way to do just that</a>.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a plethora of factors that influence a <a href="/improving-the-b2b-customer-experience-with-interactive-content/">customer’s experience</a> with your brand. One aspect of this is how you market your product or service and the support you provide along the way.</p>
<p>The information customers need should be easily accessible and readily available, so that everything they’re after is just a click away. By making this process as seamless as possible, you can capture any initial interest in your offering and move customers through the <a href="/shortening-the-b2b-marketing-sales-funnel/">B2B buying funnel</a>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>It’s also important to consider how much free content is now online, and whether this is something your competitors also have on offer. If your prospects could just as easily go to your competitors’ websites to find the answers or resources they need to make a final decision – why would they pay for your content?</p>
<h2>Add value to your brand</h2>
<p>Maybe you’ve just spent months writing an eBook, have hired a graphic designer to give it the finishing touches, and plan to invest in promoting it to your audience.</p>
<p>All of this takes time and costs your business money, but choosing not to sell your final product could actually be the best decision you make. While the revenue won’t be shown via a direct transfer of funds into your business’ account, the ongoing benefits you reap in other ways can be abundant.</p>
<p>By providing prospects and customers with this helpful content, you can nurture your leads and existing contacts to guide them through the buyer journey. This added value could be the difference between a potential customer disengaging from your brand or continuing to take in your content over time.</p>
<p>The buyer may still be uncertain, or they may not even need your product or service right now, but by ensuring you stay in touch and make a real impact, when they do eventually need an offering like yours – they’ll think of your business.</p>
<p>By providing free content, you can also reach a larger pool of customers, many of whom probably wouldn’t have downloaded your eBook, fact sheet or the like if there was a cost barrier. This means you can get more people spending longer amounts of time on your website, all of which helps with <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-seo/">search engine optimisation</a> and boosting your ranking in Google’s search results.</p>
<h2>Gain more than just sales</h2>
<p>While you may not be directly making revenue from your free content and resources, there’s so much more that you can gain if you leverage them strategically.</p>
<p>Even though you’re not charging money, you can use your eBook, fact sheet, infographic or the like to learn more about your audience. Before downloading your resource, users may need to fill out their details. This form would usually be relatively simple, with fields such as name, email address and company.</p>
<p>While at face value this information may seem insignificant, it can actually be invaluable when it comes to getting leads into the marketing funnel and nurturing them.</p>
<p>With this information, you can send consumers who have expressed clear interest in your product or service more content or communications that are relevant to them. If you have numerous resources targeting different groups, you can also segment your audience and create targeted campaigns, such as through <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/marketing-automation/">email automation</a>, which nurture consumers and ideally lead them to conversion.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in building a strong <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B content marketing</a> strategy or this article has brought up any questions, <a href="/contact-us/">get in touch with our team</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people think of marketing, outbound tactics are often the first to come to mind. Strategies of this nature are disruptive, as the consumer isn’t actively searching for the product or service being advertised to them. Businesses employing this tactic seek out potential customers and target them through relatively traditional marketing approaches.</p>
<p>Television, print or radio ads, telemarketing calls, paid email lists, video ads and the like are all considered outbound forms of advertising. Such methods are interruptive and, if you don’t pay much attention to them, you aren’t alone.</p>
<p>It’s becoming increasingly easy for consumers to avoid advertisements, which makes generating valuable outcomes from outbound marketing all the more challenging. Viewers are recording television shows so they can skip over the ads at a later time and streaming services, such as Netflix, that have no ads are continuing to grow in popularity. In fact, it’s estimated that <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/842/netflix/">37% of Internet users</a> worldwide are now using Netflix – and it’s only one of the many streaming platforms available to customers.</p>
<p>Email is another common outbound marketing technique but, similarly to ads, this tactic has its downfalls. If the recipients on your email lists aren’t interested in your content, then they can unsubscribe in just a few seconds. Alternatively, they may simply ignore your emails when scanning through their inbox. The average worker has <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/average-inbox-199-unread-emails">199 unread emails</a>, so if your message doesn’t grab their attention or appear important, you’ll likely end up being number 200.</p>
<p>So, when consumers are constantly looking for new ways to avoid your advertisements, how are you meant to reach them in meaningful ways that drive conversions? By drawing those who are genuinely interested in, and actively looking for your product or service to your business.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="/b2b-marketing-strategies/">marketing strategy</a> known as <em>inbound marketing.</em></p>
<h2>What is Inbound Marketing?</h2>
<p>When organisations implement inbound marketing strategies, they focus on creating valuable, relevant, high-quality content that attracts their target audience to their brand. Through inbound marketing, businesses can essentially ‘pull’ prospects that are interested in the type of offering they provide towards their company.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Inbound marketing is responsible for </em><a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/08/25/inbound-marketing-strategy"><em>90%+ of clicks online</em></a><em>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>By implementing a comprehensive inbound marketing strategy, brands can attract potential consumers to their business naturally. When customers search for certain content, discover your brand and deem what you’re offering as valuable to them, they’re displaying a clear interest in what you have to offer. This is why, often, inbound marketing proves to be far more effective than telling prospects that they <em>should </em>like your offering by using in-your-face tactics.</p>
<h2>Actionable Inbound Marketing Strategies</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7532" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Actionable-Inbound-Marketing-Strategies.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="350" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Actionable-Inbound-Marketing-Strategies.jpg 850w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Actionable-Inbound-Marketing-Strategies-450x185.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Actionable-Inbound-Marketing-Strategies-768x316.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>Inbound marketing tactics can be incredibly effective when implemented correctly. If you’re interested in integrating inbound marketing into your current strategy but aren’t sure where to begin, why not give one of the following a try?</p>
<h4>1. Focus on Search Engine Optimisation</h4>
<p>For any inbound marketing strategy to reach its full potential, prospects need to be able to find your brand’s content online. There are over <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/">1.7 billion websites</a>, and if potential customers can’t find your online domains, they’ll simply look to satisfy their needs elsewhere.</p>
<p><a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-seo/">Search Engine Optimisation</a> helps to boost your ranking in Google’s search results, which, in turn improves your accessibility online. It’s an approach that focuses on growing your visibility to drive more relevant, organic traffic to your website.</p>
<p>A strong <a href="/why-internal-linking-is-a-vital-part-of-any-seo-strategy/">SEO strategy</a> incorporates high-quality content, internal and external links site-wide and a functional website structure. The inclusion of keywords is also another crucial component of this tactic and it’s important that, when choosing terms to include, you select those that have both high search volume and user intent. This ensures that your online domains are appearing in relevant contexts and, thus, that you’re attracting prospects who are actually interested in your content.</p>
<h4>2. Launch a Pay-Per-Click Advertising Campaign<strong> </strong></h4>
<p><a href="/steps-to-success-with-your-b2b-paid-search-campaigns/">Paid search advertising</a> may seem out of place in an article about inbound marketing, but it can actually be a great technique to use when employing a strategy of this nature.</p>
<p>Your PPC ads will be shown in contexts where potential customers have actively sought out a topic or offering relevant to your brand. This means that rather than being disruptive, like what we see with outbound tactics, you’re essentially paying to boost your search ranking and improve your visibility. By doing this, organisations can compete for the top positions in the search results and, thus, attract a greater volume of highly relevant leads.</p>
<p>Similarly to SEO, Pay-Per-Click advertising campaigns focus on keywords that are highly relevant to your brand. However, organisations will often find that PPC delivers quicker results that SEO, which is generally more of a gradual process.</p>
<h4>3. Refresh &amp; Revolutionise Your Content Marketing</h4>
<p>Content is a crucial component of your inbound marketing strategy. If you aren’t regularly creating fresh content that delivers unique value to consumers, they’ll likely lose interest in your brand.</p>
<p>By building an effective <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B content strategy</a> into your inbound marketing approach, you’ll be able to further differentiate your brand from competitors while also giving prospects a reason to stick around. This, in turn, can help you foster ongoing, meaningful relationships with leads that achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.</p>
<p>So, what types of content could your B2B business consider creating?</p>
<ul>
<li>A frequently updated blog that covers topics directly related to your offering;</li>
<li>Downloadable resources such as guides or eBooks;</li>
<li>Case studies based on customer testimonials;</li>
<li>Infographics;</li>
<li>Videos.<strong style="color: #555555; font-size: 14.4px;"> </strong></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no secret that the market is being flooded with an abundance of new content each day. So, what sets you apart from everyone else? When designing and executing your marketing strategy, it’s crucial that you get your content right.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Compared to traditional marketing programs, content marketing costs 62% less and generates approximately three time the volume of leads” &#8211; <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/04/17/content-marketing-stats">WordStream</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>By sharing unique, relevant content with prospects, you can establish a strong brand position and differentiate your offering. Content is more than a promotional tool and, to achieve success, you will need to go beyond purely pushing for sales. Instead, focus on creating relevant content that offers exceptional value to consumers in an interesting, engaging way. Through <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B content marketing</a>, you can build and maintain meaningful relationships with customers and foster customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Want to get the most out of your content marketing? Avoid these common mistakes and start reaping the benefits of this incredibly powerful marketing tactic.</p>
<h2>No Clear Content Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>Regardless of how much content you’re generating, if it doesn’t have a clear purpose, your efforts will likely be ineffective. When developing your business strategy, it would be absurd to establish no goals or objectives for members of your organisation to strive towards. Your content marketing strategy isn’t any different.</p>
<p>With no shared direction, your businesses content will lack consistency. This sends mixed messages to customers, while also hindering your ability to perform at the frontier of your market. This is because, if everyone in your organisation is just creating content for the sake of it, while you’ll have plenty of content, it will likely lack value. By defining your audience and setting measurable goals, your team can work collaboratively towards common goals and reach new heights together.</p>
<h2>Poor Keyword Research</h2>
<p>Developing unique, targeted content is a brilliant way for organisations to improve their ranking in Google’s search results. In an increasingly digital business landscape, <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-seo/">search engine optimisation</a> has never been more important. To achieve the best results it is, however, crucial that your content is backed by accurate and thorough <a href="https://medium.com/@JBBC/common-content-marketing-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them-2afeb205ec52">keyword research</a>. If you’re not targeting the right keywords, you will likely struggle to truly optimise the visibility of your content.</p>
<p>A great way to identify high-ranking terms is to make use of online tools such as <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-adwords/">Google Ads</a> Keyword Planner, SEMrush and the like. When deciding which keywords to focus on, you will need to take various factors into account, such as the number of monthly searches they receive and their level of competitiveness.</p>
<p>You may also benefit from incorporating long tail keywords in your content, which are phrases comprising of three to five terms. Even though they generally receive less search traffic than shorter keywords, they’re more specific and, because of this, will often have a higher conversion rate.</p>
<h2>Lack of Content Variety</h2>
<p>Posting regular blogs is great, but if that’s the only type of content you’re sharing, it’s time to revaluate your content marketing strategy. People consume content differently and, while some prefer reading articles or blogs, others would rather watch videos. By sharing an array of different content, you can reach consumers in numerous interesting ways that appeal to their preferences and, consequently, keep them engaged.</p>
<p>Content creation doesn’t have to be difficult, in fact, you’ve probably already got information that can be repurposed. Old blog posts can be turned into eBooks, shared on social media, transformed into short videos and the like. This can be done with just about any form of content you’ve created in the past. It is, however, still crucial that you continue to add new, value driven content to your online domains regularly.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“60% of marketers repurpose and reuse content” – <a href="https://www.elisedopson.co.uk/blog/b2b-content-marketing-statistics/">Elise Dopson</a></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Not sure which type of content to try next? One, or more, of the following popular <a href="https://www.coredna.com/blogs/content-marketing-mistakes">content options</a> could be your ideal solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>How-to Guides</li>
<li>Checklists</li>
<li>Case Studies</li>
<li>Social Media Posts</li>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>Short Videos or Slideshows</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7547" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/web-promotion.jpg" alt="" width="935" height="328" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/web-promotion.jpg 935w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/10/web-promotion-450x158.jpg 450w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/10/web-promotion-768x269.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px" /></p>
<h2>Too Much or Too Little Promotion</h2>
<p><strong> </strong>You’re likely dedicating a significant amount of time to creating high-quality content but, if you don’t share it with customers and prospects, how will anyone actually see it? When determining how to promote your content, however, you’ll also need to ensure you’re not falling in the opposite category and <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/general/6-common-content-marketing-mistakes/">going overboard</a>. Focusing too heavily on driving sales across all of your promotions, rather than offering customers real value, may counteract your efforts.</p>
<p>When it comes to content marketing, genuinely helping consumers needs to be a priority. Content marketing isn’t purely about pushing sales, it’s about establishing and maintaining meaningful relationships with consumers that are built on trust. Through content marketing, you can provide customers with reliable, tangible evidence of your ability to fulfil their needs better than anyone else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the Content Marketing Institute’s 2018 report, 91% of B2B marketers are using content marketing to reach their customers.</p>
<p>While it’s great that so many B2B marketers are aware of how effective content marketing is for their overall strategy, it means that a vast amount of content is being generated. As such, clients and potential clients are being bombarded with messaging from businesses every day. As a result, they have learned how to filter out irrelevant information and will only engage with content that they are extremely interested in.</p>
<p>In order to succeed, <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B content marketers</a> have to stand out from the crowd and convince their audience that their content is worth taking the time to look at. This comes down to knowing exactly what you’re trying to achieve with your content marketing strategy and how it contributes to your overall marketing objectives and wider business goals. However, <a href="https://www.toprankblog.com/2015/09/b2b-content-marketing-statistics-2016/">more than half (55%) of B2B marketers report a lack of understanding when it comes to what makes for a successful content marketing strategy</a>.</p>
<p>So how do you create an effective <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B content marketing strategy</a>? First, you have to fully understand the B2B Buyer Journey.</p>
<h2>B2B Content Marketing and the Buyer Journey</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.pardot.com/buyer-journey-sfdc/">B2B buyer’s journe</a>y is typically longer and more complicated than that of a B2C buying decision. This is because more often than not, a B2B buyer’s investment is significantly larger in terms of volume and cost. In addition, there are likely to be more people depending on the buyer to make the right decision, as well as more decision makers involved in making the purchase.</p>
<p>Convincing a B2B Buyer to choose your products or services over those of your competitors comes down to trust. Building trust involves showcasing your industry expertise and offering buyers insightful information that is of value to them. This can all be effectively communicated through <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B content marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Your content marketing should be created to address the different stages of the buyer journey, with the aim of moving prospects through the stages to conversion. Bear in mind that the more helpful and valuable your content is throughout the process, the more trust you build and the more leads you generate.</p>
<h3>How to Use Content at Each Stage of the Buyer Journey</h3>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6476 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="251" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1.jpg 751w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-450x150.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p>There are a lot of <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckcohn/2015/06/16/differences-in-selling-b2b-vs-b2c/#12cedf7a1314">unique roadblocks</a> in the B2B buying process that a well thought out and executed content strategy can solve. Here are some of the things to be aware of at each stage of the buyer journey and how to move your prospects from Awareness to Consideration to Decision and Post-Purchase.</p>
<h4>Awareness</h4>
<p>The first step to getting new prospects into your sales funnel is to know exactly who you need to reach. This comes down to identifying your <a href="https://www.getcloudapp.com/blog/buyer-persona">buyer personas</a>. When creating your B2B buyer persona, you should not only identify the types of businesses that fit your ideal client, but also the exact roles and people involved in each stage of the decision.</p>
<p>At this stage, prospects haven’t heard of your business or its solutions, so it’s important to create public content that drives website and social media traffic, such as blog posts, static pages, landing pages and social posts. Content should be easy to find and target keywords and topics around the buyer persona’s interests, challenges and motivations.</p>
<h4>Consideration</h4>
<p>Once you have attracted a prospect to your business, you have to convince them that they have a problem that needs to be solved and your company’s solution is the best one for them. This is not an easy process and is likely to take more than one visit to your website. On the first visit to your website, it’s important that your content includes a call to action that aims to capture an email address or phone number so that you can move the relationship forward and nurture them through the other stages of the buying process.</p>
<p>You can do this by creating a <a href="https://www.digitalmarketer.com/blog/lead-magnet-ideas-funnel/">lead magnet</a>. A lead magnet offers something valuable to the reader, such as a whitepaper, ebook or demo, in return for their personal information.</p>
<h4>Decision</h4>
<p>Once you’ve captured a prospect’s information and you are regularly contacting them, you want your content to nurture them through to the point where they qualify as sales-ready leads. This is usually done through email marketing and marketing automation.</p>
<p>To successfully nurture prospects through this stage, customising your content based on their buyer persona is vital. Use all the data you have to send targeted, relevant content to your leads based on how they have interacted with your website and marketing materials. By segmenting customers as specifically as possible, you can send them the most relevant content for their needs, answer their questions and send product and service information and sales offers that they will be interested in, in order to convert them to customers.</p>
<h4>Post Purchase</h4>
<p>Once a prospect has moved through the sales funnel and become a client, you not only want to keep them as a return customer, but you also want to upsell them and turn them into a <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/brand_advocate.html">brand advocate</a>. Content can help you with all of this.</p>
<p>Your content at this stage should engage customers. The best way to do this is to feature customers in the content and use user-generated content that they’ll want to share. To drive engagement its important to have consistent conversations with your advocates – send them new content and business updates and ask for their insight into how you could improve your business.</p>
<h2>Content Marketing Trends to Inform Your Strategy</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6479 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2.jpg" alt="" width="751" height="569" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2.jpg 751w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2-450x341.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" /></p>
<p>Once you fully understand the stages of your buyer journey and how your content strategy relates to each of these stages, it’s important to generate content that is interesting, engaging and up to date. In order to do this, you have to stay on top of the content marketing trends that are impacting your business and your audience.</p>
<p>CMI’s <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2018/10/research-b2b-audience/">B2B Content Marketing 2019 </a>report details the developments, benchmarks, and budgets that are likely to affect content marketing going forward. The top trends every content marketer should use, according to CMI are as follows.</p>
<h3>Build Trust with Your Audience</h3>
<p><a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2018/10/research-b2b-audience/">96% of content marketers who are highly successful</a> agree that their audience considers and views their company as a trusted and credible resource for information.</p>
<p>By providing your audience with valuable information, you are creating a strong bond with them. This means that all content that is shared by your business should work towards adding value the reader and as such, deepening the trust that you have gained from them. Put simply, you want your brand to be regarded highly by your audience, so it is essential to be consistent in sharing your value with them. Your entire content strategy should be based on the ‘audience first’ mentality, where you provide your audience with the content that they need when and where they are searching for it.</p>
<h3>Have Conversations with Your Customers</h3>
<p>CMI’s B2B Content Marketing Report stated that only 42% of content marketers have regular conversations with their customers, instead, they focus more on researching their audience. These ideas should not be mutually exclusive<strong>. </strong>The most effective way to create accurate personas for your business is to research real people, which means gathering information from your current customers. By going directly to your customer you can find out their needs and preferences directly, without having to rely on third party information or data from analytics. This insight can inform the content that will be most relevant to them.</p>
<h3>Emails &amp; Educational Content are Most Effective</h3>
<p>58% of the surveyed content marketers claimed that they used content marketing successfully to gather leads or build their audience. The most effective methods for doing this were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email campaigns: 87% say this method worked</li>
<li>Educational content: 77% say this method worked</li>
</ul>
<p>From this, we can determine that, when done correctly, educational content and email campaigns are the best way to generate leads for your business. However, since there is a lot of competition for attention in consumer inboxes today, you should consider experimenting with an integrated campaign that includes email and educational content as well as Social Media advertising or SMS messaging.</p>
<h3>Keep Creating Content for Search<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>B2B marketers are finding it difficult to keep their content strategy up to date with the ever-changing search algorithms and many are concerned about the likely increase in use of voice search. In fact, 62% of businesses haven’t yet optimized for voice search.</p>
<p><em>With the</em> <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/managing-digital-marketing/marketing-innovation/business-critical-digital-marketing-trends/">digital landscape constantly changing</a><em>, </em><em>it&#8217;s more important than ever to keep your content strategy up to date with</em> the search engine algorithms. This will help you to stay one step ahead of the competition and ensure your content is found when people are searching.</p>
<h3>Incorporate Video In Your Strategy</h3>
<p>The CMI’s content marketing statistics show 72% of B2B marketers and 76% of B2C marketers use video. According to Aberdeen Group, marketers using video get 66% more leads per year.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/miketempleman/2017/09/06/17-stats-about-video-marketing/#7e88c6f6567f">more and more consumers are interacting with videos</a>, B2B Marketers who can master video marketing have a powerful tool at their disposal to help them promote and grow their business online. Videos are perfect for increasing brand engagement and have proven results in improving click-through rates, shares and band mentions. Video marketers are also reported to achieve a <a href="https://optinmonster.com/video-marketing-statistics-what-you-must-know/">54% increase in brand awareness</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">Content marketing</a> is one of the most effective ways to promote your B2B business.</p>
<p>Content tells your audience about who you are and what your business does. It builds your brand and articulates your value proposition to move customers further through the B2B buyer journey to sale.</p>
<p>Not only that; but you can’t launch a digital marketing campaign without it.</p>
<p>Content makes up the landing pages that traffic is directed to from SEO, PPC and display advertising campaigns. The content that you post is also shared and discussed across your social media channels and is used to optimise pages with <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/ux-and-cro/what-is-cro-and-why-should-we-take-it-seriously/">CRO strategies</a>. It is at the core of any digital marketing strategy and is essential for driving long-term results across a range of channels.</p>
<h2>Content For SEO</h2>
<p>The best content marketers focus more on engagement and conversions than traffic. But you still need traffic so people will see your content.</p>
<p>Search Engine Optimisation doesn’t exist without content. SEO is based on keywords, and the only way to use your keywords is to insert them strategically through your content. After <a href="https://searchengineland.com/library/google/google-panda-update">Google’s Panda update</a>, it’s vitally important that you don’t overuse keywords and over-optimise your pages. But if you can strike the right balance of keywords and content, you’ll see the results on the SERPs.</p>
<p>External links are another key <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/seo-ranking-factors/">SEO ranking factor</a>. The more links you have to your site, the more confidence Google has in it. The most effective way to get SEO links is to create excellent content that other websites want to link to.</p>
<h2>Content for Social Media</h2>
<p>B2B buyers love to do research before they buy:<a href="https://www.vividfish.co.uk/blog/55-of-b2b-buyers-search-for-information-on-social-media"> 55% of them say they look for</a> information on social media.</p>
<p>Many B2B business owners make the mistake of thinking social media isn&#8217;t relevant to them. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Social media allows you to establish connections with stakeholders, position your brand, and initiate social interactions that will improve your conversion rates. You just need to find the most appropriate channel (or channels) for your business.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified the social channels you should be on, you need content to post on them. LinkedIn is a good place to start for B2B companies, and it gives you the opportunity to post entire blogs on the platform. Other social channels let you post updates in the form of images, links and videos amongst others.</p>
<p>The content that you post on social media helps your business establish a connection with the audience. In order to be effective, you must provide unique and valuable content that shares and demonstrates the company’s values. This can build Brand Affinity, which is a great way to turn prospects into customers.</p>
<h2>Content For Website Landing Pages</h2>
<p><a href="https://blog.marketo.com/2007/10/top-5-challenge.html">Getting landing pages built and tested is one of the top five challenges for B2B marketers. </a></p>
<p>While this may not be an easy part of a digital marketer’s role, it’s a very important one. From pay per click to display advertising and social media advertising, all digital advertising campaigns require landing pages to direct traffic to. These pages need well-written content to educate visitors and motivate them to take action.</p>
<p>For paid search ads and paid social media advertising, relevancy impacts your quality score on the platform, which affects how much you pay for your ad to show. This means that the content you write for your landing page should be highly relevant to the subject of the ads. Content for all landing pages should also be written in a way that generates conversions. Using specific CTAs (Calls to Action) is the best way to tell visitors the action you want them to take on your page.</p>
<h2>Content For Conversion Rate Optimisation</h2>
<p>Landing pages are made up of a number of different elements. It’s important to continuously test and optimise these elements to find the best combination to convert for your business. This is known as Conversion Rate Optimisation. Some of the elements you are testing will be design-related, like colours and page layout. However many of them will be content based, for example, the Headline, CTA, and offers on the page. Each element should be tested one at a time so that you can effectively measure what’s working for you and make small improvements with each test. With CRO as part of your digital marketing strategy, your content will earn more and more customers for you every day.</p>
<p>Constantly creating engaging content that gets the results your business needs can be challenging. At The Lead Agency, we’re specialists in <a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-digital-content-marketing/">B2B Content Marketing</a>. We have a wealth of experience in creating content for a range of B2B companies across industries. Get in touch with us today to find out more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’ve heard of Account Based Marketing and want to know what all the fuss is about? Well, you’ve come to right place. In this article, we’re going to outline what Account Based Marketing is and how you can use it in your business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account Based Marketing was initially developed to solve the B2B problem of multiple decision makers being involved in a purchase. Rarely is there ever just one sole decision maker in a business deciding what product to buy &#8211; there can be anywhere up to a dozen decision makers in any one account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account Based Marketing can offer a lot to B2B enterprises looking to improve their ROI. According to research from the</span><a href="https://au.marketo.com/account-based-marketing/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Altera Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “97% [of B2B businesses] had a somewhat higher or much higher ROI than other marketing initiatives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas traditional lead generation is akin to fishing with a net, ABM is the equivalent of fishing with a spear. Rather than general broadcasts, you are focused on winning over key accounts. Adjusting to the demands can be difficult at first, but ABM tends to have better results, especially for B2B marketers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, how do you know who to contact? How do you personalise interactions with each decision maker? Read on for a step-by-step method to unlocking complex B2B accounts!</span></p>
<h2><b>How Does Account Based Marketing Differ From The Traditional Sales Pipeline Approach?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account Based Marketing may seem a little alien to those used to employing a sales pipeline. Metrics such as the number of qualified leads, prospects and other such demarcations don’t easily fit the Account-Based Marketing model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest differences is that Account Based Marketing is about creating quality relationships with a few key influencers and decision makers, as opposed to playing a numbers game hoping to attract significant numbers of qualified leads. You will also find that, given the low volume of accounts, you will not be able to use traditional funnel metrics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longer sales cycles will impact what types of metrics you should focus on. Given your objective is to build stronger relationships over time, engagement becomes an increasingly important metric to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account Based Marketing means that sales and marketing have to work closely together to generate real results. Demonstrating value then becomes increasingly important.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Are The Benefits of Account Based Marketing?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account-Based Marketing doesn’t mean you have to start from scratch with your existing marketing. So long as your have your executive on board, have a good team of people and  are able to align your sales and marketing, you will find that this type of marketing will slot in nicely with your existing marketing strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big businesses are run by individuals, if you can harness the power of scaled personalisation, you will find that you will be able to develop one-to-one communication quite easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the benefits of employing Account Based Marketing is a higher Return On Investment (ROI), better relationships with existing clients, and better alignment between your sales and marketing departments.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4618 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/findingyouraccount.jpg" alt="Find Your Account" width="800" height="380" /></p>
<h2><b>Step 1. Find Your Account</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a list of target accounts and then organise them according to a tiered structure. Once you have your list, you want establish how much of a percentage of your time you wish to dedicate to each tier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may wish to have three tiers set up:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first tier contains those accounts that you believe are worth investing more time in researching, developing personalised touchpoint and investing in long-term. Tactics may include heavy targeting by sales and significant support. (20-50)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second tier might be accounts you see merit in, but are not willing to spend a significant amount time in pursuing. You may choose to use tactics that are less time intensive, such as direct mail and phone calls. (200-500)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third tier will be accounts that are in your general periphery but not your focus. General marketing automation and limited personalisation would apply to this group. (2000-5000)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establishing your list of accounts is a fine balance between art and science. Use any data you have access to to establish the viability of prospects and whom you should priortise.</span></p>
<h2><b>Step 2. Map Out Who The Decision Makers Are</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have your list of accounts it’s time to get started building some generalised personas to represent different members of the teams. Yet again, prioritise these accounts according to key stakeholders, and lower influence team members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now comes the nitty-gritty of researching each target account and mapping out their staff individually. Attach your persona profiles to each contact and start building a comprehensive database. Tools for developing this could be LinkedIn, or even going through a data vendor.</span></p>
<h2><b>Step 3. Research The Account</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now comes the time to get research done on the accounts as whole. You will need to find out the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who their target market is?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their mission, vision and values?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their culture and agenda?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work dynamic within the organisation?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there any existing connections to the account?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This research can come from conversations, surveys, stalking their website and social media or even just general market data.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4618 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/createcontent.jpg" alt="Relevant Content " width="800" height="380" /></p>
<h2><b>Step 4. Create Relevant Content</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating content that is going to resonate with your different accounts is the next step. We don’t suggest you create specific content for each account but have a wide range of content that varies in its level of personalisation depending on the importance of the account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the higher end of this spectrum is content specifically for one account, at the lower end is generic broad content and in between might be content targeted towards certain industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changing the title, feature picture and headline may be all that is needed to personalise content. If you have the time and see value in a particular prospect, you may wish to spend time labouring over some more specific content.</span></p>
<h2><b>Step 5. Decide On Your Tactics For Interaction</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where all your hard work and research can finally be put to use. Now you have your accounts, and you know who you are targeting within each account, you can begin to reach out to your prospects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account Based Marketing interactions are unique in that you are applying inbound two-way communication and sharing of relevant content to an outbound marketing strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some tactics you may wish to employ may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Hosting Events </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Create, or simply host, business networking events. These events allow your sales team to get direct access to those accounts they are targeting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Direct Mail </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; In a digital world, physical mail is more likely to cut through the clutter. Creating personalised direct mail campaigns to target priority accounts is a great way to open doors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="/b2b-digital-marketing/b2b-email-marketing/"><b>Email Marketing </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; You may have general eNewsletters accounts can subscribe to, however, if you want to build two-way communication, consider avoiding smart looking templates and using more text-based personal emails.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Digital Advertising </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Use retargeting, personalised search and social media paid advertising to get to your audience. LinkedIn, for example, allows you to target your posts exclusively to certain demographics.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Free Webinars </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Host relevant and interesting webinars to get the attention of account-holders. By creating personalised invitations to events you are also able to make a good impression.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Step 6. Progress Your Strategy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the campaign is up and running, consider what your game plan is going to be. Rather than traditional tactics of broadcasting to a wide net and hoping some stick, you need to be very specific in your planning. Have a marketing flow chart prepared with the list of the different channels and tactics you plan to employ for each account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two things you need to consider when building your strategy. The first is how long you plan to run your campaign for and how often you plan to post. The second is creating a strategy employing a diverse range of integrated channels.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Philip Kotler, &#8216;The Father of Modern Marketing&#8217;, it costs 5 to 10 times more to acquire a new customer than it does to retain an existing one. Account Based Marketing is the closest you can come to selling to your existing customers. You already have a relationship with an individual (or individuals), or you may have already worked for a different division/business unit.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Account Based Marketing produces results for both Sales &amp; Marketing.</p>
<p>Account Based Marketing is a relatively new concept to many B2B marketers. Unlike traditional <a href="/the-key-elements-of-the-b2b-marketing-mix/">B2B Marketing</a> and <a href="/">Lead Generation</a>, Account Based Marketing involves concentrating sales and marketing resources on a very defined set of target accounts. Each account is targeted separately with a personalised campaign that is designed to resonate with the key decision makers in the targeted business.</p>
<p>As all marketing marketing messages and communications are crafted to address the needs of the specific account, many marketers have achieved a higher success rate with Account Based Marketing.</p>
<blockquote><p>97% of surveyed B2B Marketers said ABM had a somewhat higher or much higher ROI than other marketing initiatives [The Altera Group, 2018]</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s therefore not surprising that there has been a 21% increase in the number of companies that have a full account-based marketing program in place in the last year.</p>
<p>Despite this increase in B2B companies adopting Account Based Marketing Strategies, many still lag behind. This can often be put down to a resistance from high-level executives to invest in new marketing strategies, particularly those that they do not know a lot about.</p>
<p>However, the fact remains the same: Account based marketing works. Here is all you need to know to get it across the line at your next marketing meeting.</p>
<h2><strong>Account Based Marketing in Action</strong></h2>
<p>Account Based Marketing expert Christopher Engman best explains how the strategy can be applied to great success in a recent <a href="mailto:https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/account-based-marketing-guru-christopher-engman-its-all-hans-snel-smp/">article shared on LinkedIn</a>. Engman practices Account Based Marketing daily and is continuously learning about how to best apply the strategy to close mega deals for businesses.</p>
<p>In the article, he used the example of IBM trying to win KLM as a client. He explained that in order to close a deal with KLM, there are many employees involved from many different departments: people designing the trips, the IT department, and some C-level executives. With Account Based Marketing, all of these stakeholders can be targeted with articles, videos, and ads of IBM, that are completely relevant to the initiative IBM is discussing with KLM. As such, Account Based Marketing can be thought of as a kind of ‘lobbying’</p>
<h2><strong>Account Based Marketing Supports a Strong Alignment Between Sales and Marketing</strong></h2>
<p>Both the sales and marketing departments in an organisation are vital to closing these big deals. All too often, these two intertwined departments struggle to find common ground due to the different perception of their roles within the organisation. However, the <a href="mailto:https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/account-based-marketing-guide">entire success of an Account Based Marketing campaign hinges on the ability of these two departments to work together</a>.</p>
<p>With an Account Based Marketing strategy, marketers are focused on winning an entire account rather than generating individual leads for sales to close, so arguments over lead quantity and lead quality are non-existent. Sales and Marketing teams are working together as a single unit towards a common goal. This is perhaps the biggest obstacle to most companies thinking of engaging in Account Based Marketing, as only 60% of businesses say they&#8217;re “somewhat” or “tightly” aligned with sales.</p>
<h2><strong>Resources are Optimised with Account Based Marketing<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Account Based Marketing minimises wasted resources as it is extremely targeted. With such a narrow focus, Account Based Marketers put all of their effort and resources into targeting the company’s key accounts that will drive the most revenue. This allows them to optimise their most valuable resources: staff time and money.</p>
<p>While the strategy maximises the efficiency of marketing and sales resources, it also helps build the communication channels to create a united sales and marketing organisation. This can benefit the business as a whole, as organisations with aligned sales and marketing teams see an average of 32% annual revenue growth, while less aligned companies see a 7% decline in growth [Forrester Research, 2015].</p>
<h2><strong>Account Based Marketing Creates Better Customer Experiences</strong></h2>
<p>With Account Based Marketing, all messaging and communications with prospect clients are personalised to specific accounts to ensure the campaigns resonate with these target audiences. All marketers know that personalised marketing strategies lead to increased engagement, for example, we all personalise email introductions with a name rather than simply saying ‘Dear Customer’. Account-based marketing takes personalisation to the next level by developing content specifically for key decision makers that addresses their problems and needs at their point in the buyer journey. In order to successfully get the attention of the decision maker, and move them further along the buyer journey, content should be in-depth and highly researched.</p>
<p>By focusing on delivering content that is completely customer centric and adds value to the reader, Account Based Marketing creates an extremely positive experience for the customer.</p>
<h2><strong>Account Based Marketing Increases ROI<br />
</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.itsma.com/research/account-based-marketing-and-roi-building-the-case-for-investment/">A 2014 ITSMA survey</a> revealed that “nearly all B2B solution providers that measure account-based marketing (ABM) ROI find that ABM delivers higher ROI than other marketing initiatives.”</p>
<p>As a B2B marketer, we’ve all come across the situation where we’ve had to justify our budget to clients or C Level executives. However, putting resources into Account Based Marketing should be a no brainer. You are targeting already established companies to win accounts that have great potential now and into the future instead of wasting time and resources on gaining and managing multiple small accounts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, tracking your ROI is much easier with Account Based Marketing as there are fewer points of investment and a controlled and easy-to-track sales funnel. It&#8217;s much simpler for marketers to see which strategies are working, and which clients are responding, and providing the greatest return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Content is King” has been the mantra of the online marketing world in recent years, and the phenomenon is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>However, many content marketers have become complacent. According to the <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/research/">Content Marketing Institute</a> less than 40% of all content marketers are effective at content marketing. It seems that Content Marketing has become more about churning out article after article, blog after blog, and creating content to fill a weekly quota rather than to really benefit the reader (and subsequently, the business).</p>
<p>While the production of quick content may generate short term results such as a spike in traffic or a low-quality lead, it is likely to have long-term consequences for your brand. Bad quality content can result in a loss of brand reputation as well as low quality leads and opportunities.</p>
<p>You can’t, and shouldn’t try to trick your customers into purchase. To use <a href="/b2b-marketing-services/b2b-content-marketing/">Content Marketing</a> to its full potential, you have to treat your customers by making it valuable.</p>
<h3><strong>Tailor Your Content to Buyer Personas</strong></h3>
<p>Before curating your content, it’s important to consider how it will be of benefit to the reader. In order to do this is you should consider buyer personas.</p>
<p>A buyer persona is more than a one-dimensional profile of the people you want to influence, or a map of their journey, but rather it reveals insights about your buyers’ decisions, attitudes and concerns. A good buyer persona will outline the reasons and criteria that drive prospective customers to choose you over your competitors and provide invaluable insight that you can use to inform your content marketing strategy.</p>
<h3><strong>Segment Your Audience</strong></h3>
<p>Effective marketing is relevant marketing and segmenting your blog can drive more leads and more sales. Similar to buyer personas, a segment is a group of customers that share similar demographics, and/ or psychographics.</p>
<p>By developing these groups, you can create a content strategy that includes different topics, formats and mediums that specifically address the drivers, motivations and fears of each one. Creating more relevant content based on your prospect’s goals and interests, is more likely to catch their attention influence them, and drive a desired action.</p>
<h3><strong>Address Your Prospect’s Point in the Buyer Journey</strong></h3>
<p>By tailoring your content to the prospect’s specific point in their buyer journey, you can more quickly move them through the Sales Funnel to purchase. In order to do this, you should collect data on the pain-points, interests and activities of prospects at each individual stage, and use this to inform content that is unique to each stage in the funnel.</p>
<p>This highly targeted form of nurturing positions your company as a helpful resource to buyers, and makes them more likely to respond to your communications.</p>
<h3><strong>Encourage Conversions</strong></h3>
<p>In order to ensure ROI with content marketing, the content that you create should be delivered in a way that encourages conversions and generates results. In order to make your prospects more likely to convert, remove any distractions in your content and focus on a single point that guides the reader toward the end goal. Use language that invokes feelings of immediacy and fosters a sense of urgency, as the fear of missing out is a highly effective sales tool that can drive prospects to conversion. Finally, don’t be overly promotional with your content. While you should always include a call to action, it has to be appropriate, relevant and engaging.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/b2b-marketing-services/b2b-content-marketing/">Content marketing</a> is one of those terms that gets thrown around in the business world without much further explanation. It relates back to all other aspects of marketing it seems, with SEO, ROI, lead generation and many more essential components of success often linked directly to content. Everyone knows it’s important but… what is content marketing?!</p>
<p>Wikipedia will tell you that Content Marketing is any marketing that involves the creation and sharing of media and publishing content in order to acquire and retain customers. But what does this really mean for B2B marketers?</p>
<p>70% of B2B Marketers surveyed say they are creating more content than they did one year ago, with 23% saying that they publish new content daily [Content Marketing Institute, 2014].</p>
<p>Modern day marketers are learning that traditional marketing is becoming less and less effective by the second. 77% of people watch TV while using another device [Moz, 2015] and with the introduction of providers like Netflix and Foxtel IQ, consumers will no longer tolerate sitting through ads. They have become pros at ignoring and tuning out magazine and newspaper advertising and they know how to hide particular content from newsfeeds online in order to filter out the companies they don’t wish to see. The average consumer is now so adept at online “surfing” that they can take in information without a care for banners or buttons, thus making them irrelevant. In fact, the average click-through rate (CTR) of display ads is 0.1% [Moz, 2015], this is has been coined “Banner Blindness”</p>
<p>Cue Content Marketing…</p>
<p>The contemporary consumer has now come to expect a steady stream of relevant and valuable curated content as well as regular and engaging <em>original</em> content from the companies that they respect. This shift towards consumers valuing and engaging with marketers who make the effort to own media rather than rent it has become integrated into every good marketers strategy.</p>
<p>While outbound marketing interrupts consumers, inbound marketing attracts and engages prospects in an organic way. Sponsored content doesn’t guarantee engagement [Moz, 2015].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There are 3 key aspects to successful content marketing:</h2>
<h3>1. It <em>can </em>and <em>should</em> come in many forms</h3>
<p>If you wish to remain relevant you need to create more than just one type of content. You may think that your company creates amazing “how-to” blogs and that you should dedicate all your time to doing that, however, consumers have a short attention span and if you are always providing content to them in the same form you risk losing their interest.</p>
<p>Consider utilising alternative means of presentation for your content, such as; infographics, videos, whitepapers, press releases and so on.</p>
<h3>2. It should cover various topics</h3>
<p>It’s all well and fine that your company specialises in one specific field, however if the scope of the content your producing is too narrow you risk a) running out of original ideas and repeating yourself, and b) boring your audience.</p>
<p>Ensure you are posting relevant content about and related to your specialty so that your viewers feel they are gaining a deeper insight into what you offer and your company’s beliefs.</p>
<h3>3. It needs to be made available on multiple platforms</h3>
<p>In order to achieve optimal reach with your content it is important that you make it available through a range of marketing mediums.</p>
<p>Just posting updates to your company’s website is not likely to steer a huge amount of traffic to the page. Sharing is key! Once new content is made available, let your audience know via social media platforms and newsletters so that they are reminded of you and directed to continue consuming the information you can provide for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketers need to think in terms of delivering an experience that will make people want to come back and share your content with friends. Do this by turning your qualitative and quantitative data into quality content. If you provide a myriad of information, published to multiple platforms in varying forms you are well on your way to keeping today’s fickle readers, watchers and listeners engaged.</p>
